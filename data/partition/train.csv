"State of the art computer vision models have been shown to be vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations of the input. In other words, most images in the data distribution are both correctly classified by the model and are very close to a visually similar misclassified image. Despite substantial research interest, the cause of the phenomenon is still poorly understood and remains unsolved. We hypothesize that this counter intuitive behavior is a naturally occurring result of the high dimensional geometry of the data manifold. As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we study a simple synthetic dataset of classifying between two concentric high dimensional spheres. For this dataset we show a fundamental tradeoff between the amount of test error and the average distance to nearest error. In particular, we prove that any model which misclassifies a small constant fraction of a sphere will be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of size O(1/sqrt(d)). Surprisingly, when we train several different architectures on this dataset, all of their error sets naturally approach this theoretical bound. As a result of the theory, the vulnerability of neural networks to small adversarial perturbations is a logical consequence of the amount of test error observed. We hope that our theoretical analysis of this very simple case will point the way forward to explore how the geometry of complex real-world data sets leads to adversarial examples.",1
"Consider a cost-sharing game with players of different costs: an example might be an insurance company calculating premiums for a population of mixed-risk individuals. Two natural and competing notions of fairness might be to a) charge each individual the same or b) charge each individual according to the cost that they bring to the pool. In the insurance literature, these approaches are referred to as ""solidarity"" and ""actuarial fairness"" and are commonly viewed as opposites. However, in insurance (and many other natural settings), the cost-sharing game also exhibits externalities of size: all else being equal, larger groups have lower average cost. In the insurance case, we analyze model where costs strictly decreases with pooling due to a reduction in the variability of losses. In this paper, we explore how this complicates traditional understandings of fairness, drawing on literature in cooperative game theory. First, we explore solidarity: we show that it is possible for both groups (high risk and low risk) to strictly benefit by joining an insurance pool where costs are evenly split, as opposed to being in separate risk pools. We build on this by producing a pricing scheme that maximally subsidizes the high risk group, while maintaining an incentive for lower risk people to stay in the insurance pool. Next, we demonstrate that with this new model, the price charged to each individual has to depend on the risk of other participants, making naive actuarial fairness inefficient. Furthermore, we prove that stable pricing schemes must be ones where players have the antisocial incentive desiring riskier partners, contradicting motivations for using actuarial fairness. Finally, we describe how these results relate to debates about fairness in machine learning and potential avenues for future research.",1
"We derive the optimal $(0, \delta)$-differentially private query-output independent noise-adding mechanism for single real-valued query function under a general cost-minimization framework. Under a mild technical condition, we show that the optimal noise probability distribution is a uniform distribution with a probability mass at the origin. We explicitly derive the optimal noise distribution for general $\ell^p$ cost functions, including $\ell^1$ (for noise magnitude) and $\ell^2$ (for noise power) cost functions, and show that the probability concentration on the origin occurs when $\delta > \frac&lbrace;p&rbrace;&lbrace;p+1&rbrace;$. Our result demonstrates an improvement over the existing Gaussian mechanisms  by a factor of two and three for $(0,\delta)$-differential privacy in the high privacy regime in the context of minimizing the noise magnitude and noise power, and the gain is more pronounced in the low privacy regime. Our result is consistent with the existing result for $(0,\delta)$-differential privacy in the discrete setting, and identifies a probability concentration phenomenon in the continuous setting.",1
"It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples. In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear. Here we argue that the origin of adversarial examples is primarily due to an inherent uncertainty that neural networks have about their predictions. We show that the functional form of this uncertainty is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; and depends only on the statistics of the logit differences of the network, which do not change significantly during training. This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-theart deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD). Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness. Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity. To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10. Our resulting architecture is more robust to white and black box attacks compared to previous attempts.",1
"Police departments around the world have been experimenting with forms of place-based data-driven proactive policing for over two decades. Modern incarnations of such systems are commonly known as hot spot predictive policing. These systems predict where future crime is likely to concentrate such that police can allocate patrols to these areas and deter crime before it occurs. Previous research on fairness in predictive policing has concentrated on the feedback loops which occur when models are trained on discovered crime data, but has limited implications for models trained on victim crime reporting data. We demonstrate how differential victim crime reporting rates across geographical areas can lead to outcome disparities in common crime hot spot prediction models. Our analysis is based on a simulation1 patterned after district-level victimization and crime reporting survey data for Bogotá, Colombia. Our results suggest that differential crime reporting rates can lead to a displacement of predicted hotspots from high crime but low reporting areas to high or medium crime and high reporting areas. This may lead to misallocations both in the form of over-policing and under-policing.",0
"Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. One application of ML is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. However, no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. In this paper, we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. In two evaluations with pathologists, we found that these refinement tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. The tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. We also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ML errors from their own errors. Taken together, these findings inform future human-ML collaborative systems for expert decision-making.",1
"Anomaly detection aims to find instances that are considered unusual and is a fundamental problem of data science. Recently, deep anomaly detection methods were shown to achieve superior results particularly in complex data such as images. Our work focuses on deep one-class classification for anomaly detection which learns a mapping only from the normal samples. However, the non-linear transformation performed by deep learning can potentially find patterns associated with social bias. The challenge with adding fairness to deep anomaly detection is to ensure both making fair and correct anomaly predictions simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for the fair anomaly detection approach (Deep Fair SVDD) and train it using an adversarial network to de-correlate the relationships between the sensitive attributes and the learned representations. This differs from how fairness is typically added namely as a regularizer or a constraint. Further, we propose two effective fairness measures and empirically demonstrate that existing deep anomaly detection methods are unfair. We show that our proposed approach can remove the unfairness largely with minimal loss on the anomaly detection performance. Lastly, we conduct an in-depth analysis to show the strength and limitations of our proposed model, including parameter analysis, feature visualization, and run-time analysis.",0
"This paper examines the role of technology firms in computerizing personality tests from the early 1960s to late 1980s. It focuses on the National Computer Systems (NCS) and their development of an automated interpretation for the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality inventory (MMPI). NCS trumpeted their computerized interpretation as a way to free up clerical labor and mitigate human bias. Yet psychologists cautioned that proprietary algorithms risked obscuring decision rules. I show how clinics, courtrooms, and businesses all had competing interests in the use of computerized personality tests. As I argue, the development of computerized psychological tests was shaped both by business concerns about intellectual property and profits and psychologists' concerns with validity and access to algorithms. Across these domains, the common claim was that computerized psychological testing could provide a technical fix for bias. This paper contributes to histories of computing emphasizing the importance of IP, the relationship between labor, technology, and expertise, and to histories of algorithms.",0
"The potential for learned models to amplify existing societal biases has been broadly recognized. Fairness-aware classifier constraints, which apply equality metrics of performance across subgroups defined on sensitive attributes such as race and gender, seek to rectify inequity but can yield non-uniform degradation in performance for skewed datasets.  In certain domains, imbalanced degradation of performance can yield another form of unintentional bias. In the spirit of constructing fairness-aware algorithms as societal imperative, we explore an alternative: Pareto-Efficient Fairness (PEF).  PEF identifies the operating point on the Pareto curve of subgroup performances closest to the fairness hyperplane, maximizing multiple subgroup accuracies. Empirically we demonstrate that PEF increases performance of all subgroups in several UCI datasets.",1

"Automated decision-making systems implemented in public life are typically standardized. One algorithmic decision-making system can replace thousands of human deciders. Each of the humans so replaced had her own decision-making criteria: some good, some bad, and some arbitrary. Is such arbitrariness of moral concern? We argue that an isolated arbitrary decision need not morally wrong the individual whom it misclassifies. However, if the same algorithms are applied across a public sphere, such as hiring or lending, a person could be excluded from a large number of opportunities. This harm persists even when the automated decision-making systems are ""fair"" on standard metrics of fairness. We argue that such arbitrariness at scale is morally problematic and propose technically informed solutions that can lessen the impact of algorithms at scale and so mitigate or avoid the moral harms we identify.",0
"The long-term impact of algorithmic decision making is shaped by the dynamics between the deployed decision rule and individuals' response. Focusing on settings where each individual desires a positive classification---including many important applications such as hiring and school admissions, we study a dynamic learning setting where individuals invest in a positive outcome based on their group's expected gain and the decision rule is updated to maximize institutional benefit. By characterizing the equilibria of these dynamics, we show that natural challenges to desirable long-term outcomes arise due to heterogeneity across groups and the lack of realizability. We consider two interventions, decoupling the decision rule by group and subsidizing the cost of investment. We show that decoupling achieves optimal outcomes in the realizable case but has discrepant effects that may depend on the initial conditions otherwise. In contrast, subsidizing the cost of investment is shown to create better equilibria for the disadvantaged group even in the absence of realizability.",1
"The criminal justice system is currently ill-equipped to improve outcomes of individuals who cycle in and out of the system with a series of misdemeanor offenses. Often due to constraints of caseload and poor record linkage, prior interactions with an individual may not be considered when an individual comes back into the system, let alone in a proactive manner through the application of diversion programs. The Los Angeles City Attorney's Office recently created a new Recidivism Reduction and Drug Diversion unit (R2D2) tasked with reducing recidivism in this population. Here we describe a collaboration with this new unit as a case study for the incorporation of predictive equity into machine learning based decision making in a resource-constrained setting. The program seeks to improve outcomes by developing individually-tailored social service interventions (i.e., diversions, conditional plea agreements, stayed sentencing, or other favorable case disposition based on appropriate social service linkage rather than traditional sentencing methods) for individuals likely to experience subsequent interactions with the criminal justice system, a time and resource-intensive undertaking that necessitates an ability to focus resources on individuals most likely to be involved in a future case. Seeking to achieve both efficiency (through predictive accuracy) and equity (improving outcomes in traditionally under-served communities and working to mitigate existing disparities in criminal justice outcomes), we discuss the equity outcomes we seek to achieve, describe the corresponding choice of a metric for measuring predictive fairness in this context, and explore a set of options for balancing equity and efficiency when building and selecting machine learning models in an operational public policy setting.",0
"Computer vision is widely deployed, has highly visible, society-altering applications, and documented problems with bias and representation. Datasets are critical for benchmarking progress in fair computer vision, and often employ broad racial categories as population groups for measuring group fairness. Similarly, diversity is often measured in computer vision datasets by ascribing and counting categorical race labels. However, racial categories are ill-defined, unstable temporally and geographically, and have a problematic history of scientific use. Although the racial categories used across datasets are superficially similar, the complexity of human race perception suggests the racial system encoded by one dataset may be substantially inconsistent with another. Using the insight that a classifier can learn the racial system encoded by a dataset, we conduct an empirical study of computer vision datasets supplying categorical race labels for face images to determine the cross-dataset consistency and generalization of racial categories. We find that each dataset encodes a substantially unique racial system, despite nominally equivalent racial categories, and some racial categories are systemically less consistent than others across datasets. We find evidence that racial categories encode stereotypes, and exclude ethnic groups from categories on the basis of nonconformity to stereotypes. Representing a billion humans under one racial category may obscure disparities and create new ones by encoding stereotypes of racial systems. The difficulty of adequately converting the abstract concept of race into a tool for measuring fairness underscores the need for a method more flexible and culturally aware than racial categories.",0
"The increasing impact of algorithmic decisions on people's lives compels us to scrutinize their fairness and, in particular, the disparate impacts that ostensibly-color-blind algorithms can have on different groups. Examples include credit decisioning, hiring, advertising, criminal justice, personalized medicine, and targeted policymaking, where in some cases legislative or regulatory frameworks for fairness exist and define specific protected classes. In this paper we study a fundamental challenge to assessing disparate impacts, or performance disparities in general, in practice: protected class membership is often not observed in the data. This is particularly a problem in lending and healthcare. We consider the use of an auxiliary dataset, such as the US census, that includes protected class labels but not decisions or outcomes. We show that a variety of common disparity measures are generally unidentifiable aside for some unrealistic cases, providing a new perspective on the documented biases of popular proxy-based methods. We provide exact characterizations of the sharpest-possible partial identification set of disparities either under no assumptions or when we incorporate mild smoothness constraints. We further provide optimization-based algorithms for computing and visualizing these sets of simultaneously achievable pairwise disparties for assessing disparities that arise between multiple groups, which enables reliable and robust assessments - an important tool when disparity assessment can have far-reaching policy implications. We demonstrate this in two case studies with real data: mortgage lending and personalized medicine dosing.",0
"A single algorithm drives an important health care decision for over 70 million people in the US. When health systems anticipate that a patient will have especially complex and intensive future health care needs, she is enrolled in a 'care management' program, which provides considerable additional resources: greater attention from trained providers and help with coordination of her care. To determine which patients will have complex future health care needs, and thus benefit from program enrollment, many systems rely on an algorithmically generated commercial risk score. In this paper, we exploit a rich dataset to study racial bias in a commercial algorithm that is deployed nationwide today in many of the US's most prominent Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). We document significant racial bias in this widely used algorithm, using data on primary care patients at a large hospital. Blacks and whites with the same algorithmic risk scores have very different realized health. For example, the highest-risk black patients (those at the threshold where patients are auto-enrolled in the program), have significantly more chronic illnesses than white enrollees with the same risk score. We use detailed physiological data to show the pervasiveness of the bias: across a range of biomarkers, from HbA1c levels for diabetics to blood pressure control for hypertensives, we find significant racial health gaps conditional on risk score. This bias has significant material consequences for patients: it effectively means that white patients with the same health as black patients are far more likely be enrolled in the care management program, and benefit from its resources. If we simulated a world without this gap in predictions, blacks would be auto-enrolled into the program at more than double the current rate. An unusual aspect of our dataset is that we observe not just the risk scores but also the input data and objective function used to construct it. This provides a unique window into the mechanisms by which bias arises. The algorithm is given a data frame with (1) Yit (label), total medical expenditures ('costs') in year t; and (2) Xi,t--1 (features), fine-grained care utilization data in year t -- 1 (e.g., visits to cardiologists, number of x-rays, etc.). The algorithm's predicted risk of developing complex health needs is thus in fact predicted costs. And by this metric, one could easily call the algorithm unbiased: costs are very similar for black and white patients with the same risk scores. So far, this is inconsistent with algorithmic bias: conditional on risk score, predictions do not favor whites or blacks. The fundamental problem we uncover is that when thinking about 'health care needs,' hospitals and insurers focus on costs. They use an algorithm whose specific objective is cost prediction, and from this perspective, predictions are accurate and unbiased. Yet from the social perspective, actual health -- not just costs -- also matters. This is where the problem arises: costs are not the same as health. While costs are a reasonable proxy for health (the sick do cost more, on average), they are an imperfect one: factors other than health can drive cost -- for example, race. We find that blacks cost more than whites on average; but this gap can be decomposed into two countervailing effects. First, blacks bear a different and larger burden of disease, making them costlier. But this difference in illness is offset by a second factor: blacks cost less, holding constant their exact chronic conditions, a force that dramatically reduces the overall cost gap. Perversely, the fact that blacks cost less than whites conditional on health means an algorithm that predicts costs accurately across racial groups will necessarily also generate biased predictions on health. The root cause of this bias is not in the procedure for prediction, or the underlying data, but the algorithm's objective function itself. This bias is akin to, but distinct from, 'mis-measured labels': it arises here from the choice of labels, not their measurement, which is in turn a consequence of the differing objective functions of private actors in the health sector and society. From the private perspective, the variable they focus on -- cost -- is being appropriately optimized. But our results hint at how algorithms may amplify a fundamental problem in health care as a whole: externalities produced when health care providers focus too narrowly on financial motives, optimizing on costs to the detriment of health. In this sense, our results suggest that a pervasive problem in health care -- incentives that induce health systems to focus on dollars rather than health -- also has consequences for the way algorithms are built and monitored.",0
"The use of counterfactuals for considerations of algorithmic fairness and explainability is gaining prominence within the machine learning community and industry. This paper argues for more caution with the use of counterfactuals when the facts to be considered are social categories such as race or gender. We review a broad body of papers from philosophy and social sciences on social ontology and the semantics of counterfactuals, and we conclude that the counterfactual approach in machine learning fairness and social explainability can require an incoherent theory of what social categories are. Our findings suggest that most often the social categories may not admit counterfactual manipulation, and hence may not appropriately satisfy the demands for evaluating the truth or falsity of counterfactuals. This is important because the widespread use of counterfactuals in machine learning can lead to misleading results when applied in high-stakes domains. Accordingly, we argue that even though counterfactuals play an essential part in some causal inferences, their use for questions of algorithmic fairness and social explanations can create more problems than they resolve. Our positive result is a set of tenets about using counterfactuals for fairness and explanations in machine learning.",1
"This Article offers a comprehensive survey of privacy dependencies—the many ways that our privacy depends on the decisions and disclosures of other people. What we do and what we say can reveal as much about others as it does about ourselves, even when we don’t realize it or when we think we’re sharing information about ourselves alone. We identify three bases upon which our privacy can depend: our social ties, our similarities to others, and our differences from others. In a tie-based dependency, an observer learns about one person by virtue of her social relationships with others—family, friends, or other associates. In a similarity-based dependency, inferences about our unrevealed attributes are drawn from our similarities to others for whom that attribute is known. And in difference-based dependencies, revelations about ourselves demonstrate how we are different from others—by showing, for example, how we “break the mold” of normal behavior or establishing how we rank relative to others with respect to some desirable attribute. We elaborate how these dependencies operate, isolating the relevant mechanisms and providing concrete examples of each mechanism in practice, the values they implicate, and the legal and technical interventions that may be brought to bear on them. Our work adds to a growing chorus demonstrating that privacy is neither an individual choice nor an individual value— but it is the first to systematically demonstrate how different types of dependencies can raise very different normative concerns, implicate different areas of law, and create different challenges for regulation.",1
"The rise of machine learning around the globe in fields like medicine, education, employment, credit lending, and criminal sentencing has the potential to reflect and reinforce societal biases at large scale through the models deployed. While fairness concerns are multifaceted, technical evaluations and improvements of models are a critical aspect of a developer's role. And, for these considerations to truly scale, they must integrate into existing processes. In particular, we focus on seamlessly integrating known technical methods with existing libraries used for the training, evaluation, and deployment of models.  To showcase the suite of tools built in Tensorflow, we present an interactive case study demo in conjunction with Conversation AI, an ML research initiative to make online conversations more inclusive.",1
"A key problem in information retrieval is understanding the latent intention of a user's under-specified query. Retrieval models that are able to correctly uncover the query intent often perform well on the document ranking task. In this paper we study the problem of interpretability for text based ranking models by trying to unearth the query intent as understood by complex retrieval models. We propose a model-agnostic approach that attempts to locally approximate a complex ranker by using a simple ranking model in the term space. Given a query and a blackbox ranking model, we propose an approach that systematically exploits preference pairs extracted from the target ranking and document perturbations to identify a set of intent terms and a simple term based ranker that can faithfully and accurately mimic the complex blackbox ranker in that locality. Our results indicate that we can indeed interpret more complex models with high fidelity. We also present a case study on how our approach can be used to interpret recently proposed neural rankers.",0
"Diversity in personalized news recommender systems is often defined as dissimilarity, and operationalized based on topic diversity (e.g., corona versus farmers strike). Diversity in news media, however, is understood as multiperspectivity (e.g., different opinions on corona measures), and arguably a key responsibility of the press in a democratic society. While viewpoint diversity is often considered synonymous with source diversity in communication science domain, in this paper, we take a computational view. We operationalize the notion of framing, adopted from communication science. We apply this notion to a re-ranking of topic-relevant recommended lists, to form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method. Our offline evaluation indicates that the proposed method is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists according to a diversity metric from literature. In an online study, on the Blendle platform, a Dutch news aggregator, with more than 2000 users, we found that users are willing to consume viewpoint diverse news recommendations. We also found that presentation characteristics significantly influence the reading behaviour of diverse recommendations. These results suggest that future research on presentation aspects of recommendations can be just as important as novel viewpoint diversification methods to truly achieve multiperspectivity in online news environments.",1
"This paper uses a theory of oppression to ground and extend algorithmic oppression. Algorithmic oppression is then situated through a Black feminist lens part of which entails highlighting the double bind of technology. To reconcile algorithmic oppression with respect to the fairness, accountability, and transparency community, I critique the language of the community. Lastly, I place algorithmic oppression in a broader conversation of feminist science, technology, and society studies to ground the discussion of ways forward through abolition and empowering marginalized communities.",0
"Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled machines to generate cohesive open-ended text when prompted with a sequence of words as context. While these models now empower many downstream applications from conversation bots to automatic storytelling, they have been shown to generate texts that exhibit social biases. To systematically study and benchmark social biases in open-ended language generation, we introduce the Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology. We also propose new automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended text generation from multiple angles. An examination of text generated from three popular language models reveals that the majority of these models exhibit a larger social bias than human-written Wikipedia text across all domains. With these results we highlight the need to benchmark biases in open-ended language generation and caution users of language generation models on downstream tasks to be cognizant of these embedded prejudices.",1
"Building equitable and inclusive technologies demands paying attention to how social attitudes towards persons with disabilities are represented within technology. Representations perpetuated by NLP models often inadvertently encode undesirable social biases from the data on which they are trained. In this paper, first we present evidence of such undesirable biases towards mentions of disability in two different NLP models: toxicity prediction and sentiment analysis. Next, we demonstrate that neural embeddings that are critical first steps in most NLP pipelines also contain undesirable biases towards mentions of disabilities. We then expose the topical biases in the social discourse about some disabilities which may explain such biases in the models; for instance, terms related to gun violence, homelessness, and drug addiction are over-represented in discussions about mental illness.",1
"Algorithmic risk assessments are increasingly used to help humans make decisions in high-stakes settings, such as medicine, criminal justice and education. In each of these cases, the purpose of the risk assessment tool is to inform actions, such as medical treatments or release conditions, often with the aim of reducing the likelihood of an adverse event such as hospital readmission or recidivism. Problematically, most tools are trained and evaluated on historical data in which the outcomes observed depend on the historical decision-making policy. These tools thus reflect risk under the historical policy, rather than under the different decision options that the tool is intended to inform. Even when tools are constructed to predict risk under a specific decision, they are often improperly evaluated as predictors of the target outcome. Focusing on the evaluation task, in this paper we define counterfactual analogues of common predictive performance and algorithmic fairness metrics that we argue are better suited for the decision-making context. We introduce a new method for estimating the proposed metrics using doubly robust estimation. We provide theoretical results that show that only under strong conditions can fairness according to the standard metric and the counterfactual metric simultaneously hold. Consequently, fairness-promoting methods that target parity in a standard fairness metric may---and as we show empirically, do---induce greater imbalance in the counterfactual analogue. We provide empirical comparisons on both synthetic data and a real world child welfare dataset to demonstrate how the proposed method improves upon standard practice.",0
"Now that machine learning algorithms lie at the center of many important resource allocation pipelines, computer scientists have been unwittingly cast as partial social planners. Given this state of affairs, important questions follow. How do leading notions of fairness as defined by computer scientists map onto longer-standing notions of social welfare? In this paper, we present a welfare-based analysis of fair classification regimes. Our main findings assess the welfare impact of fairness-constrained empirical risk minimization programs on the individuals and groups who are subject to their outputs. We fully characterize the ranges of Δ'e perturbations to a fairness parameter 'e in a fair Soft Margin SVM problem that yield better, worse, and neutral outcomes in utility for individuals and by extension, groups. Our method of analysis allows for fast and efficient computation of ""fairness-to-welfare"" solution paths, thereby allowing practitioners to easily assess whether and which fair learning procedures result in classification outcomes that make groups better-off. Our analyses show that applying stricter fairness criteria codified as parity constraints can worsen welfare outcomes for both groups. More generally, always preferring ""more fair"" classifiers does not abide by the Pareto Principle---a fundamental axiom of social choice theory and welfare economics. Recent work in machine learning has rallied around these notions of fairness as critical to ensuring that algorithmic systems do not have disparate negative impact on disadvantaged social groups. By showing that these constraints often fail to translate into improved outcomes for these groups, we cast doubt on their effectiveness as a means to ensure fairness and justice.",0
"We propose a simple yet highly effective method that addresses the mode-collapse problem in the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). Although conditional distributions are multi-modal (i.e., having many modes) in practice, most cGAN approaches tend to learn an overly simplified distribution where an input is always mapped to a single output regardless of variations in latent code. To address such issue, we propose to explicitly regularize the generator to produce diverse outputs depending on latent codes. The proposed regularization is simple, general, and can be easily integrated into most conditional GAN objectives. Additionally, explicit regularization on generator allows our method to control a balance between visual quality and diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three conditional generation tasks: image-to-image translation, image inpainting, and future video prediction. We show that simple addition of our regularization to existing models leads to surprisingly diverse generations, substantially outperforming the previous approaches for multi-modal conditional generation specifically designed in each individual task.",1
"Most commonly used learning algorithms work by iteratively updating an intermediate solution using one or a few data points in each iteration.  Analysis of differential privacy for such algorithms often involves ensuring privacy of each step and then reasoning about the cumulative privacy cost of the algorithm. This is enabled by composition theorems for differential privacy that allow releasing of all the intermediate results.  In this work, we demonstrate that for contractive iterations, not releasing the intermediate results strongly amplifies the privacy guarantees. ",1
"Algorithmic recommendations mediate interactions between millions of customers and products (in turn, their producers and sellers) on large e-commerce marketplaces like Amazon. In recent years, the producers and sellers have raised concerns about the fairness of black-box recommendation algorithms deployed on these marketplaces. Many complaints are centered around marketplaces biasing the algorithms to preferentially favor their own 'private label' products over competitors. These concerns are exacerbated as marketplaces increasingly de-emphasize or replace 'organic' recommendations with ad-driven 'sponsored' recommendations, which include their own private labels. While these concerns have been covered in popular press and have spawned regulatory investigations, to our knowledge, there has not been any public audit of these marketplace algorithms. In this study, we bridge this gap by performing an end-to-end systematic audit of related item recommendations on Amazon. We propose a network-centric framework to quantify and compare the biases across organic and sponsored related item recommendations. Along a number of our proposed bias measures, we find that the sponsored recommendations are significantly more biased toward Amazon private label products compared to organic recommendations. While our findings are primarily interesting to producers and sellers on Amazon, our proposed bias measures are generally useful for measuring link formation bias in any social or content networks.",0
"Research to date aimed at the fairness, accountability, and transparency of algorithmic systems has largely focused on topics such as identifying failures of current systems and on technical interventions intended to reduce bias in computational processes. Researchers have given less attention to methods that account for the social and political contexts of specific, situated technical systems at their points of use. Co-developing algorithmic accountability interventions in communities supports outcomes that are more likely to address problems in their situated context and re-center power with those most disparately affected by the harms of algorithmic systems. In this paper we report on our experiences using participatory and co-design methods for algorithmic accountability in a project called the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit. The main insights we gleaned from our experiences were: (i) many meaningful interventions toward equitable algorithmic systems are non-technical; (ii) community organizations derive the most value from localized materials as opposed to what is ""scalable"" beyond a particular policy context; (iii) framing harms around algorithmic bias suggests that more accurate data is the solution, at the risk of missing deeper questions about whether some technologies should be used at all. More broadly, we found that community-based methods are important inroads to addressing algorithmic harms in their situated contexts.",0
"Often one would like to allocate shared resources in a fair way. A common and well studied notion of fairness is Max-Min Fairness, where we first maximize the smallest allocation, and subject to that the second smallest, and so on. We consider a networking application where multiple commodities compete over the capacity of a network. In our setting each commodity has multiple possible paths to route its demand (for example, a network using MPLS tunneling). In this setting, the only known way of finding a max-min fair allocation requires an iterative solution of multiple linear programs. Such an approach, although polynomial time, scales badly with the size of the network, the number of demands, and the number of paths. More importantly, a network operator has limited control and understanding of the inner working of the algorithm. Finally, this approach is inherently centralized and cannot be implemented via a distributed protocol. In this paper we introduce Upward Max-Min Fairness, a novel relaxation of Max-Min Fairness and present a family of simple dynamics that converge to it. These dynamics can be implemented in a distributed manner. Moreover, we present an efficient combinatorial algorithm for finding an upward max-min fair allocation, which is a natural extension of the well known Water Filling Algorithm for a multiple path setting. We test the expected behavior of this new algorithm and show that on realistic networks upward max-min fair allocations are comparable to the max-min fair allocations both in fairness and in network utilization.",1
"Crowdsourcing systems increasingly rely on users to provide more subjective ground truth for intelligent systems - e.g. ratings, aspect of quality and perspectives on how expensive or lively a place feels, etc. We focus on the ubiquitous implementation of online user ordinal voting (e.g 1-5, 1 star-4 stars) on some aspect of an entity, to extract a relative truth, measured by a selected metric such as vote plurality or mean. We argue that this methodology can aggregate results that yield little information to the end user. In particular, ordinal user rankings often converge to a indistinguishable rating. This is demonstrated by the trend in certain cities for the majority of restaurants to all have a 4 star rating. Similarly, the rating of an establishment can be significantly affected by a few users. User bias in voting is not spam, but rather a preference that can be harnessed to provide more information to users. We explore notions of both global skew and user bias. Leveraging these bias and preference concepts, the paper suggests explicit models for better personalization and more informative ratings.",1
"Translating verbose information needs into crisp search queries is a phenomenon that is ubiquitous but hardly understood. Insights into this process could be valuable in several applications, including synthesizing large privacy-friendly query logs from public Web sources which are readily available to the academic research community. In this work, we take a step towards understanding query formulation by tapping into the rich potential of community question answering (CQA) forums. Specifically, we sample natural language (NL) questions spanning diverse themes from the Stack Exchange platform, and conduct a large-scale conversion experiment where crowdworkers submit search queries they would use when looking for equivalent information. We provide a careful analysis of this data, accounting for possible sources of bias during conversion, along with insights into user-specific linguistic patterns and search behaviors. We release a dataset of 7,000 question-query pairs from this study to facilitate further research on query understanding.",1
"We introduce and illustrate a new approach to measuring and mitigating unintended bias in machine learning models. Our definition of unintended bias is parameterized by a test set and a subset of input features. We illustrate how this can be used to evaluate text classifiers using a synthetic test set and a public corpus of comments annotated for toxicity from Wikipedia Talk pages. We also demonstrate how imbalances in training data can lead to unintended bias in the resulting models, and therefore potentially unfair applications. We use a set of common demographic identity terms as the subset of input features on which we measure bias. This technique permits analysis in the common scenario where demographic information on authors and readers is unavailable, so that bias mitigation must focus on the content of the text itself. The mitigation method we introduce is an unsupervised approach based on balancing the training dataset. We demonstrate that this approach reduces the unintended bias without compromising overall model quality",1
"Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many clients (e.g., mobile devices or whole organizations) collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server (e.g., service provider), while keeping the training data decentralized. FL embodies the principles of focused data collection and minimization, and mitigates many of the systemic privacy risks and costs resulting from traditional, centralized machine learning and data science approaches. Motivated by the explosive growth in FL research, this paper discusses recent advances and presents a comprehensive list of open problems and challenges.",1
"To build machine learning systems that are reliable, trustworthy, and fair, we must be able to provide relevant stakeholders with an understanding of how these systems work. Yet what makes a system “intelligible” is difficult to pin down. Intelligibility is a fundamentally human-centered concept that lacks a one-size-fits-all solution. Although many intelligibility techniques have been proposed in the machine learning literature, there are many more open questions about how best to provide stakeholders with the information they need to achieve their desired goals. In this chapter, we begin with an overview of the intelligible machine learning landscape and give several examples of the diverse ways in which needs for intelligibility can arise. We provide an overview of the techniques for achieving intelligibility that have been proposed in the machine learning literature. We discuss the importance of taking a human-centered strategy when designing intelligibility techniques or when verifying that these techniques achieve their intended goals. We also argue that the notion of intelligibility should be expanded beyond machine learning models to other components of machine learning systems, such as datasets and performance metrics. Finally, we emphasize the necessity of tight integration between the machine learning and human–computer interaction communities.",1
"Personalization is pervasive in the online space as it leads to higher efficiency for the user and higher revenue for the platform by individualizing the most relevant content for each user. However, recent studies suggest that such personalization can learn and propagate systemic biases and polarize opinions; this has led to calls for regulatory mechanisms and algorithms that are constrained to combat bias and the resulting echo-chamber effect. We propose a versatile framework that allows for the possibility to reduce polarization in personalized systems by allowing the user to constrain the distribution from which content is selected. We then present a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees that satisfies the given constraints on the types of the content that can be displayed to a user, but -- subject to these constraints -- will continue to learn and personalize the content in order to maximize utility. We illustrate this framework on a curated dataset of online news articles that are conservative or liberal, show that it can control polarization, and examine the trade-off between decreasing polarization and the resulting loss to revenue. We further exhibit the flexibility and scalability of our approach by framing the problem in terms of the more general diverse content selection problem and test it empirically on both a News dataset and the MovieLens dataset.",0
"Price discrimination - offering different prices to different customers - has become common practice. While it allows sellers to increase their profits, it also raises several concerns in terms of fairness. This topic has received extensive attention from media, industry, and regulatory agencies. In this paper, we consider the problem of setting prices for different groups under fairness constraints. In this paper, we propose a formal framework for pricing with fairness, including several definitions of fairness and their potential impact on consumers, sellers, and society at large. In a first step towards the ambitious agenda of designing pricing strategies that are fair, we consider the simplest scenario of a single-product seller facing consumers who can be partitioned into two groups based on a single, binary feature observable to the seller. For each group, we assume that the seller knows the valuation distribution and the population size. The seller's goal is to maximize profit by optimally selecting a price for each group, subject to a fairness constraint which may be self-imposed or explicitly enforced by laws and regulations. We first propose four definitions: fairness in price, demand, consumer surplus, and no-purchase valuation. With our model and definitions in place, we first show that satisfying all four fairness goals simultaneously is impossible unless the mean valuations are the same for both groups. In fact, even achieving two fairness measures simultaneously cannot be done in basic settings. We then consider the impact of imposing each fairness criterion separately, and identify conditions under which the consumer surplus and the social welfare increase or decrease. Under linear or exponential demand, we show that imposing a small amount of fairness in price or no-purchase valuation increases social welfare, whereas fairness in demand or surplus reduces social welfare. We fully characterize the impact of imposing different types of fairness for linear demand. We discover that imposing too much price fairness may result in a lower social welfare relative to imposing no price fairness. Imposing demand and surplus fairness always decreases social welfare. However, imposing no-purchase valuation fairness always increases social welfare. We also extend our results to the cases when there are multiple groups or there is an unprotected feature. Finally, we computationally show that most of our findings continue to hold for three common nonlinear demand models. Our results and insights provide a first step in understanding the impact of imposing fairness in the context of pricing.",0
"This paper critically examines arguments against independence, a measure of group fairness also known as statistical parity and as demographic parity. In recent discussions of fairness in computer science, some have maintained that independence is not a suitable measure of group fairness. This position is at least partially based on two influential papers (Dwork et al., 2012, Hardt et al., 2016) that provide arguments against independence. We revisit these arguments, and we find that the case against independence is rather weak. We also give arguments in favor of independence, showing that it plays a distinctive role in considerations of fairness. Finally, we discuss how to balance different fairness considerations.",0
"The use of word embedding models in sentiment analysis has gained a lot of traction in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. However, many inherently neutral word vectors describing demographic identity have unintended implicit correlations with negative or positive sentiment, resulting in unfair downstream machine learning algorithms. We leverage adversarial learning to decorrelate demographic identity term word vectors with positive or negative sentiment, and re-embed them into the word embeddings. We show that our method effectively minimizes unfair positive/negative sentiment polarity while retaining the semantic accuracy of the word embeddings. Furthermore, we show that our method effectively reduces unfairness in downstream sentiment regression and can be extended to reduce unfairness in toxicity classification tasks.",0
"With rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI), popularity of generative art has grown substantially. From creating paintings to generating novel art styles, AI based generative art has showcased a variety of applications. However, there has been little focus concerning the ethical impacts of AI based generative art. In this work, we investigate biases in the generative art AI pipeline right from those that can originate due to improper problem formulation to those related to algorithm design. Viewing from the lens of art history, we discuss the socio-cultural impacts of these biases. Leveraging causal models, we highlight how current methods fall short in modeling the process of art creation and thus contribute to various types of biases. We illustrate the same through case studies, in particular those related to style transfer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive analysis that investigates biases in the generative art AI pipeline from the perspective of art history. We hope our work sparks interdisciplinary discussions related to accountability of generative art.",1
"The potential for machine learning (ML) systems to amplify social inequities and unfairness is receiving increasing popular and academic attention. A surge of recent work has focused on the development of algorithmic tools to assess and mitigate such unfairness. If these tools are to have a positive impact on industry practice, however, it is crucial that their design be informed by an understanding of real-world needs. Through 35 semi-structured interviews and an anonymous survey of 267 ML practitioners, we conduct the first systematic investigation of commercial product teams’ challenges and needs for support in developing fairer ML systems. We identify areas of alignment and disconnect between the challenges faced by industry practitioners and solutions proposed in the fair ML research literature. Based on these findings, we highlight directions for future ML and HCI research that will better address industry practitioners’ needs.",1
"We propose a novel method to explain trained deep neural networks (DNNs), by distilling them into surrogate models using unsupervised clustering.

Via user studies, we show that our model can improve user trust in modelâs prediction.",1
"We analyze the adversarial examples problem in terms of a modelâs fault tolerance with respect to its input.

"Academics, activists, and regulators are increasingly urging companies to develop and deploy sociotechnical systems that are fair and unbiased. Achieving this goal, however, is complex: the developer must (1) deeply engage with social and legal facets of ""fairness"" in a given context, (2) develop software that concretizes these values, and (3) undergo an independent algorithm audit to ensure technical correctness and social accountability of their algorithms. To date, there are few examples of companies that have transparently undertaken all three steps. In this paper we outline a framework for algorithmic auditing by way of a case-study of pymetrics, a startup that uses machine learning to recommend job candidates to their clients. We discuss how pymetrics approaches the question of fairness given the constraints of ethical, regulatory, and client demands, and how pymetrics' software implements adverse impact testing. We also present the results of an independent audit of pymetrics' candidate screening tool. We conclude with recommendations on how to structure audits to be practical, independent, and constructive, so that companies have better incentive to participate in third party audits, and that watchdog groups can be better prepared to investigate companies.",1
"In this paper we argue that standard calls for explainability that focus on the epistemic inscrutability of black-box machine learning models may be misplaced. If we presume, for the sake of this paper, that machine learning can be a source of knowledge, then it makes sense to wonder what kind of justification it involves. How do we rationalize on the one hand the seeming justificatory black box with the observed widespread adoption of machine learning? We argue that, in general, people implicitly adopt reliabilism regarding machine learning. Reliabilism is an epistemological theory of epistemic justification according to which a belief is warranted if it has been produced by a reliable process or method. We argue that, in cases where model deployments require moral justification, reliabilism is not sufficient, and instead justifying deployment requires establishing robust human processes as a moral âwrapperâ around machine outputs. We then suggest that, in certain high-stakes domains with moral consequences, reliabilism does not provide another kind of necessary justificationâmoral justification. Finally, we offer cautions relevant to the (implicit or explicit)adoption of the reliabilist interpretation of machine learning.",1
"Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach which enables training on a large corpus of data which never needs to leave user devices.

"Nowadays, the use of machine learning models is becoming a utility in many applications. Companies deliver pre-trained models encapsulated as application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers combine with third-party components and their own models and data to create complex data products to solve specific problems. The complexity of such products and the lack of control and knowledge of the internals of each component used unavoidable cause effects, such as lack of transparency, difficulty in auditability, and the emergence of potential uncontrolled risks. They are effectively black-boxes. Accountability of such solutions is a challenge for the auditors and the machine learning community. In this work, we propose a wrapper that given a black-box model enriches its output prediction with a measure of uncertainty when applied to a target domain. To develop the wrapper, we follow these steps: Modeling the distribution of the output. In a text classification setting, the output is a probability distribution p(y|X, w*) over the different classes to predict, y, given an input text X and the pre-trained model with parameters w*. We model this output by a random variable to measure the variability that the data noise causes in the output. Here we consider the output distribution coming from a Dirichlet probability density function, thus p(y|X, w*) ~ Dir(α). Decomposition of the Dirichlet concentration parameter. To relate the output of the classifier with the concentration parameter in the Dirichlet distribution, we propose a decomposition of the concentration parameter in two terms: α = βy. The role of this scalar β is to control the spread of the distribution around the expected value, i.e. the original prediction y. Training the wrapper. Sentences are represented as the average value of their word embeddings. This representation feeds a neural network that outputs a single regression value that models the parameter β. For each input, we combine β and the black-box prediction to obtain the corresponding distribution for the output ym,i ~ Dir(αi). By using Monte Carlo sampling, we approximate the expected value of the classification probabilities, [EQUATION] and we train the model applying a cross-entropy loss over the predictions and the labels. Obtaining an uncertainty score from the wrapper. To obtain a numerical value for the uncertainty of a prediction, we draw samples from the resulting Dir(α) to evaluate the predictive entropy with [EQUATION], thus obtaining a numerical score for the uncertainty of each prediction. Using uncertainty for rejection. Based on this wrapper, we provide an actionable mechanism to mitigate risk in the form of decision rejection: once equipped with a value for the uncertainty of a given prediction, we can choose not to issue that prediction when the risk or uncertainty in that decision is significant. This results in a rejection system that selects the more confident predictions, discards those more uncertain, and leads to an improvement in the trustability of the resulting system. We showcase the proposed technique and methodology in a practical scenario where we apply a simulated sentiment analysis API based on NLP to different domains. On each experiment, we train a sentiment classifier using text reviews of products in a source domain. We apply the pre-trained black-box to obtain the predictions for the reviews from a target domain. The tuples of review plus black-box predictions are then used for training the wrapper to obtain the uncertainty. Finally, we use the uncertainty score to sort the predictions from more to less uncertain, and we search for a rejection point that maximizes the three performance measures: non-rejected accuracy, and classification and rejection quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the uncertainty measure computed by the wrapper and shows its high correlation to bad quality predictions and misclassifications. In all the cases, the uncertainty metric here proposed outperforms traditional uncertainty measures.",0
"Social media monitoring by law enforcement is becoming commonplace, but little is known about what software packages for it do. Through public records requests, we obtained log files from the Corvallis (Oregon) Police Department's use of social media monitoring software called DigitalStakeout. These log files include the results of proprietary searches by DigitalStakeout that were running over a period of 13 months and include 7240 social media posts. In this paper, we focus on the Tweets logged in this data and consider the racial and ethnic identity (through manual coding) of the users that are therein flagged by DigitalStakeout. We observe differences in the demographics of the users whose Tweets are flagged by DigitalStakeout compared to the demographics of the Twitter users in the region, however, our sample size is too small to determine significance. Further, the demographics of the Twitter users in the region do not seem to reflect that of the residents of the region, with an apparent higher representation of Black and Hispanic people. We also reconstruct the keywords related to a Narcotics report set up by DigitalStakeout for the Corvallis Police Department and find that these keywords flag Tweets unrelated to narcotics or flag Tweets related to marijuana, a drug that is legal for recreational use in Oregon. Almost all of the keywords have a common meaning unrelated to narcotics (e.g. broken, snow, hop, high) that call into question the utility that such a keyword based search could have to law enforcement. As social media monitoring is increasingly used for law enforcement purposes, racial biases in surveillance may contribute to existing racial disparities in law enforcement practices. We are hopeful that log files obtainable through public records request will shed light on the operation of these surveillance tools. There are challenges in auditing these tools: public records requests may go unfulfilled even if the data is available, social media platforms may not provide comparable data for comparison with surveillance data, demographics can be difficult to ascertain from social media and Institutional Review Boards may not understand how to weigh the ethical considerations involved in this type of research. We include in this paper a discussion of our experience in navigating these issues.",0
"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a genre of deep learning model of significant practical and theoretical interest for their facility in producing photorealistic 'fake' images which are plausibly similar, but not identical, to a corpus of training data. But from the perspective of a sociologist, the distinctive architecture of GANs is highly suggestive. First, a convolutional neural network for classification, on its own, is (at present) popularly considered to be an 'AI'; and a generative neural network is a kind of inversion of such a classification network (i.e. a layered transformation from a vector of numbers to an image, as opposed to a transformation from an image to a vector of numbers). If, then, in the training of GANs, these two 'AIs' interact with each other in a dyadic fashion, shouldn't we consider that form of learning... social? This observation can lead to some surprising associations as we compare and contrast GANs with the theories of the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, whose concept of the so-called habitus is one which is simultaneously cognitive and social: a productive perception in which classification practices and practical action cannot be fully disentangled. Bourdieu had long been concerned with the reproduction of social stratification: his early works studied formal public schooling in France not as an egalitarian system but instead as one which unintentionally maintained the persistence of class distinctions. It was, he argued, through the cultural inculcation of an embodied and partially unconscious habitus---a ""durably installed generative principle of regulated improvisations""---that, he argued, students from the upper classes are given an advantage which is only further reinforced throughout their educational trajectories. For Bourdieu, institutions of schooling instill ""deeply interiorized master patterns"" of behavior and thought (and classification) which in turn direct the acquisition of subsequent patterns, whose character is determined not simply by this cognitive layering but by their actual use in lived practice, especially early in childhood development. In this work I develop a productive analogy between the GAN architecture and Bourdieu's habitus, in three ways. First, I call attention to the fact that connectionist approaches and Bourdieu's theories were both conceived as revolts against rule-bound paradigms. In the 1980s, Rumelhart and McClelland used a multilayer neural network to learn the phonology of English past-tense verbs because ""sometimes we don't follow the rules... language is full of exceptions to the rules""; and in the case of Bourdieu, the habitus was an answer to a long-standing question: ""how can behaviour be regulated without being the product of obedience to rules?"" Bourdieu strove to transgress what was then seen in the social sciences as a conceptual opposition between structure-based theories of social life and those which emphasized an embodied agency. Second, I suggest that concerns about bias and discrimination in machine learning in recent years can in part be attributed due to the increased use of ML models not just for static classification but for practical action. Similarly, the habitus for Bourdieu is simultaneously durable and transposable: its judgments may be relatively stable, but are capable of being deployed dynamically in novel and varying social situations---or what ML practitioners might call generalizability. We can thus theorize generative models (including GANs) as biased not just in their stereotyped classifications, but through their potential for actively generating new biased data. These generated actions then recursively become part of the social arena Bourdieu called the field, into which new agents are 'born' and for which they may know few alternatives. Finally, it is intriguing that GAN researchers and Bourdieu both extensively use metaphors from game theory. Goodfellow described the GAN architecture as a ""two-player minimax game with value function V(G,D)"", meaning that there is a single abstract function whose output value the discriminator is trying to maximize and which the generator is trying to minimize; but the dynamic nature of the GAN training process means that convergence to Nash equilibrium is nontrivial. But for Bourdieu, such a utility-based approach to artistic creation could not be more crude when compared to the social reality of art worlds: utilitarianism is, for him, ""the degree zero of sociology"", by which he means an isolated, inert, and amodal---and therefore not particularly sociological---starting point. Moreover, 19th-century bohemian culture was characterized primarily by its inversion of financial incentives, in which failure is a kind of success, and ""selling out"" (i.e. maximizing profit) worst of all; and thus the relentless optimization of neural networks may be fundamentally at odds with the ""value functions"" of many human artists. I conclude that deep learning, while primarily understood as a scientific and technical achievement, may also intentionally or unintentionally constitute a nascent, independent reinvention of social theory.",0
"The interpretation of deep learning models is a challenge due to their size, complexity, and often opaque internal state. In addition, many systems, such as image classifiers, operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which provide an interpretation of a neural net's internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result--for example, how sensitive a prediction of âzebraâ is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.",1
"The growing volume of digital data stimulates the adoption of recommender systems in different socioeconomic domains, including news industries. While news recommenders help consumers deal with information overload and increase their engagement, their use also raises an increasing number of societal concerns, such as ""Matthew effects"", ""filter bubbles"", and the overall lack of transparency. We argue that focusing on transparency for content-providers is an under-explored avenue. As such, we designed a simulation framework called SIREN1 (SImulating Recommender Effects in online News environments), that allows content providers to (i) select and parameterize different recommenders and (ii) analyze and visualize their effects with respect to two diversity metrics. Taking the U.S. news media as a case study, we present an analysis on the recommender effects with respect to long-tail novelty and unexpectedness using SIREN. Our analysis offers a number of interesting findings, such as the similar potential of certain algorithmically simple (item-based k-Nearest Neighbour) and sophisticated strategies (based on Bayesian Personalized Ranking) to increase diversity over time. Overall, we argue that simulating the effects of recommender systems can help content providers to make more informed decisions when choosing algorithmic recommenders, and as such can help mitigate the aforementioned societal concerns.",0

"Recently, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have been severely criticized by policy makers, and media watchdog groups for allowing fake news stories to spread unchecked on their platforms. In response, these sites are encouraging their users to report any news story they encounter on the site, which they perceive as fake. Stories that are reported as fake by a large number of users are prioritized for fact checking by (human) experts at fact checking organizations like Snopes and PolitiFact. Thus, social media sites today are relying on their users' perceptions of the truthfulness of news stories to select stories to fact check. However, few studies have focused on understanding how users perceive truth in news stories, or how biases in their perceptions might affect current strategies to detect and label fake news stories. To this end, we present an in-depth analysis on users' perceptions of truth in news stories. Specifically, we analyze users' truth perception biases for 150 stories fact checked by Snopes. Based on their ground truth and the truth value perceived by users, we can classify the stories into four categories -- (i) C1: false stories perceived as false by most users, (ii) C2: true stories perceived as false by most users, (iii) C3: false stories perceived as true by most users, and (iv) C4: true stories perceived as true by most users. The stories that are likely to be reported (flagged) for fact checking are from the two classes C1 and C2 that have the lowest perceived truth levels. We argue that there is little to be gained by fact checking stories from C1 whose truth value is correctly perceived by most users. Although stories in C2 reveal the cynicality of users about true stories, social media sites presently do not explicitly mark them as true to resolve the confusion. On the contrary, stories in C3 are false stories, yet perceived as true by most users. Arguably, these stories are more damaging than C1 because the truth values of the the story in former situation is incorrectly perceived while truth values of the latter is correctly perceived. Nevertheless, the stories in C1 is likely to be fact checked with greater priority than the stories in C3! In fact, in today's social media sites, the higher the gullibility of users towards believing a false story, the less likely it is to be reported for fact checking. In summary, we make the following contributions in this work. 1. Methodological: We develop a novel method for assessing users' truth perceptions of news stories. We design a test for users to rapidly assess (i.e., at the rate of a few seconds per story) how truthful or untruthful the claims in a news story are. We then conduct our truth perception tests on-line and gather truth perceptions of 100 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers for each story. 2. Empirical: Our exploratory analysis of users' truth perceptions reveal several interesting insights. For instance, (i) for many stories, the collective wisdom of the crowd (average truth rating) differs significantly from the actual truth of the story, i.e., wisdom of crowds is inaccurate, (ii) across different stories, we find evidence for both false positive perception bias (i.e., a gullible user perceiving the story to be more true than it is in reality) and false negative perception bias (i.e., a cynical user perceiving a story to be more false than it is in reality), and (iii) users' political ideologies influence their truth perceptions for the most controversial stories, it is frequently the result of users' political ideologies influencing their truth perceptions. 3. Practical: Based on our observations, we call for prioritizing stories to fact check in order to achieve the following three important goals: (i) Remove false news stories from circulation, (ii) Correct the misperception of the users, and (iii) Decrease the disagreement between different users' perceptions of truth. Finally, we provide strategies which utilize users' truth perceptions (and predictive analysis of their biases) to achieve the three goals stated above while prioritizing stories for fact checking.

"A central promise of machine learning (ML) is to use historical data to project the future trajectories of patients.  Will they have a good or bad outcome? What diagnoses will they have?

"Recent advances in machine learning leverage massive datasets of unlabeled images from the web to learn general-purpose image representations for tasks from image classification to face recognition. But do unsupervised computer vision models automatically learn implicit patterns and embed social biases that could have harmful downstream effects? We develop a novel method for quantifying biased associations between representations of social concepts and attributes in images. We find that state-of-the-art unsupervised models trained on ImageNet, a popular benchmark image dataset curated from internet images, automatically learn racial, gender, and intersectional biases. We replicate 8 previously documented human biases from social psychology, from the innocuous, as with insects and flowers, to the potentially harmful, as with race and gender. Our results closely match three hypotheses about intersectional bias from social psychology. For the first time in unsupervised computer vision, we also quantify implicit human biases about weight, disabilities, and several ethnicities. When compared with statistical patterns in online image datasets, our findings suggest that machine learning models can automatically learn bias from the way people are stereotypically portrayed on the web.",0
"The word 'ethics' is under siege in technology policy circles. Weaponized in support of deregulation, self-regulation or handsoff governance, ""ethics"" is increasingly identified with technology companies' self-regulatory efforts and with shallow appearances of ethical behavior. So-called ""ethics washing"" by tech companies is on the rise, prompting criticism and scrutiny from scholars and the tech community at large. In parallel to the growth of ethics washing, its condemnation has led to a tendency to engage in ""ethics bashing."" This consists in the trivialization of ethics and moral philosophy now understood as discrete tools or pre-formed social structures such as ethics boards, self-governance schemes or stakeholder groups. The misunderstandings underlying ethics bashing are at least threefold: (a) philosophy and ""ethics"" are seen as a communications strategy and as a form of instrumentalized cover-up or façade for unethical behavior, (b) philosophy is understood in opposition and as alternative to political representation and social organizing and (c) the role and importance of moral philosophy is downplayed and portrayed as mere ""ivory tower"" intellectualization of complex problems that need to be dealt with in practice. This paper argues that the rhetoric of ethics and morality should not be reductively instrumentalized, either by the industry in the form of ""ethics washing,"" or by scholars and policy-makers in the form of ""ethics bashing."" Grappling with the role of philosophy and ethics requires moving beyond both tendencies and seeing ethics as a mode of inquiry that facilitates the evaluation of competing tech policy strategies. In other words, we must resist narrow reductivism of moral philosophy as instrumentalized performance and renew our faith in its intrinsic moral value as a mode of knowledgeseeking and inquiry. Far from mandating a self-regulatory scheme or a given governance structure, moral philosophy in fact facilitates the questioning and reconsideration of any given practice, situating it within a complex web of legal, political and economic institutions. Moral philosophy indeed can shed new light on human practices by adding needed perspective, explaining the relationship between technology and other worthy goals, situating technology within the human, the social, the political. It has become urgent to start considering technology ethics also from within and not only from outside of ethics.",0
"Named Entity Recognition (NER) has been mostly studied in the context of written text. Specifically, NER is an important step in de-identification (de-ID) of medical records, many of which are recorded conversations between a patient and a doctor. In such recordings, audio spans with personal information should be redacted, similar to the redaction of sensitive character spans in de-ID for written text. The application of NER in the context of audio de-identification has yet to be fully investigated. To this end, we define the task of audio de-ID, in which audio spans with entity mentions should be detected. We then present our pipeline for this task, which involves Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), NER on the transcript text, and text-to-audio alignment. Finally, we introduce a novel metric for audio de-ID and a new evaluation benchmark consisting of a large labeled segment of the Switchboard and Fisher audio datasets and detail our pipeline's results on it.",1
"We study risk-sensitive imitation learning where the agent's goal is to perform at least as well as the expert in terms of a risk profile. We first formulate our risk-sensitive imitation learning setting. We consider the generative adversarial approach to imitation learning (GAIL) and derive an optimization problem for our formulation, which we call it risk-sensitive GAIL (RS-GAIL). We then derive two different versions of our RS-GAIL optimization problem that aim at matching the risk profiles of the agent and the expert w.r.t. Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence and Wasserstein distance, and develop risk-sensitive generative adversarial imitation learning algorithms based on these optimization problems. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms and compare them with GAIL and the risk-averse imitation learning (RAIL) algorithms in two MuJoCo and two OpenAI classical control tasks.",1
"Most recommender systems base their recommendations on implicit or explicit item-level feedback provided by users. These item ratings are combined into a complex user model, which then predicts the suitability of other items. While effective, such methods have limited scrutability and transparency. For instance, if a user's interests change, then many item ratings would usually need to be modified to significantly shift the user's recommendations. Similarly, explaining how the system characterizes the user is impossible, short of presenting the entire list of known item ratings. In this paper, we present a new set-based recommendation technique that permits the user model to be explicitly presented to users in natural language, empowering users to understand recommendations made and improve the recommendations dynamically. While performing comparably to traditional collaborative filtering techniques in a standard static setting, our approach allows users to efficiently improve recommendations. Further, it makes it easier for the model to be validated and adjusted, building user trust and understanding.",1
"Given a growing concern about the lack of ethical consideration in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, many have begun to question how dominant approaches to the disciplinary education of computer science (CS)---and its implications for AI---has led to the current ""ethics crisis"". However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of ""exclusionary pedagogy,"" where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as ""ethical unicorns"" that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited. Through an analysis of computer science education literature and a review of college-level course syllabi in AI ethics, we discuss the limitations of the epistemological assumptions and hierarchies of knowledge which dictate current attempts at including ethics education in CS training and explore evidence for the practical mechanisms through which this exclusion occurs. We then propose a shift towards a substantively collaborative, holistic, and ethically generative pedagogy in AI education.",0
"The issue of disagreements amongst human experts is a ubiquitous one in both machine learning and medicine. In medicine, this often corresponds to doctor disagreements on a patient diagnosis. In this work, we show that machine learning models can be successfully trained to give uncertainty scores to data instances that result in high expert disagreements. In particular, they can identify patient cases that would benefit most from a medical second opinion. Our central methodological finding is that Direct Uncertainty Prediction (DUP), training a model to predict an uncertainty score directly from the raw patient features, works better than Uncertainty Via Classification, the two step process of training a classifier and postprocessing the output distribution to give an uncertainty score. We show this both with a theoretical result, and on extensive evaluations on a large scale medical imaging application.",1
"Implicit bias is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities (or lack thereof) to a member from a particular social group (e.g., defined by gender or race). Studies on implicit bias have shown that these unconscious stereotypes can have adverse outcomes in various social contexts, such as job screening, teaching, or policing. Recently, [34] considered a mathematical model for implicit bias and showed the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule as a constraint to improve the utility of the outcome for certain cases of the subset selection problem. Here we study the problem of designing interventions for the generalization of subset selection - ranking - that requires to output an ordered set and is a central primitive in various social and computational contexts. We present a family of simple and interpretable constraints and show that they can optimally mitigate implicit bias for a generalization of the model studied in [34]. Subsequently, we prove that under natural distributional assumptions on the utilities of items, simple, Rooney Rule-like, constraints can also surprisingly recover almost all the utility lost due to implicit biases. Finally, we augment our theoretical results with empirical findings on real-world distributions from the IIT-JEE (2009) dataset and the Semantic Scholar Research corpus.",0
"Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.",1
"There is a growing attention on the notion of fairness in the GDPR in the European legal literature. However, the principle of fairness in the Data Protection framework is still ambiguous and uncertain, as computer science literature and interpretative guidelines reveal. This paper looks for a better understanding of the concept of fairness in the data protection field through two parallel methodological tools: linguistic comparison and contextual interpretation. In terms of linguistic comparison, the paper analyses all translations of the world ""fair"" in the GDPR in the EU official languages, as the CJEU suggests in CILFIT Case for the interpretation of the EU law. The analysis takes into account also the translation of the notion of fairness in other contiguous fields (e.g. at Article 8 of the EU Charter of fundamental rights or in the Consumer field, e.g. Unfair terms directive or Unfair commercial practice directive). In general, the notion of fairness is translated with several different nuances (in accordance or in discordance with the previous Data protection Directive and with Article 8 of the Charter) In some versions different words are used interchangeably (it is the case of French, Spanish and Portuguese texts), in other versions there seems to be a specific rationale for using different terms in different parts of the GDPR (it is the case of German and Greek version). The analysis reveals three mean semantic notions: correctness (Italian, Swedish, Romanian), loyalty (French, Spanish, Portuguese and the German version of ""Treu und Glaube"") and equitability (French, Spanish and Portuguese). Interestingly, these three notions have common roots in the Western legal history: the Roman law notion of ""bona fide"". Taking into account both the value of ""bona fide"" in the current European legal contexts and also a contextual interpretation of the role of fairness in the GDPR, the preliminary conclusions is that fairness refers to a substantial balancing of interests among data controllers and data subjects. The approach of fairness is effect-based: what is relevant is not the formal respect of procedures (in terms of transparency, lawfulness or accountability), but the substantial mitigation of unfair imbalances that create situations of ""vulnerability"". Building on these reflections, the paper analyses how the notion of fairness and imbalance are related to the idea of vulnerability, within and beyond the GDPR. In sum, the article suggests that the best interpretation of the fairness principles in the GDPR (taking into account both the notion of procedural fairness and of fair balancing) is the mitigation of data subjects' vulnerabilities through specific safeguards and measures.",0
"The deployment of facial recognition systems in high-stakes scenarios has sparked widespread concerns about privacy, fairness, and accountability. A common response to these concerns is the suggestion of adding a human in the loop to provide oversight and ensure fairness and accountability. However, the effectiveness of this approach is seldom studied empirically, and humans are known to have biases of their own. In this position paper, we argue for the necessity of empirical studies of human-in-the-loop facial recognition systems. We outline several technical and ethical challenges that arise when conducting such empirical studies and when interpreting their results. Our goal is to initiate a discussion about ways for AI and HCI researchers to work together on human-centered approaches to empirically studying human-in-the-loop facial recognition systems.",1
"Interpretability has become an important topic of research as more machine learning (ML) models are deployed and widely used to make important decisions. Most of the current explanation methods provide explanations through feature importance scores, which identify features that are salient for each individual input. However, how to systematically summarize and interpret such per sample feature importance scores itself is challenging. In this work, we propose principles and desiderata for \emph&lbrace;concept&rbrace; based explanation, which goes beyond per-sample features to identify higher level human-understandable concepts that apply across the entire dataset. We develop a new algorithm, ACE, to automatically extract visual concepts. Our systematic experiments demonstrate that ACE discovers concepts that are human-meaningful, coherent and salient for the neural network's predictions.",1
"This paper introduces reviewability as a framework for improving the accountability of automated and algorithmic decisionmaking (ADM) involving machine learning. We draw on an understanding of ADM as a socio-technical process involving both human and technical elements, beginning before a decision is made and extending beyond the decision itself. While explanations and other model-centric mechanisms may assist some accountability concerns, they often provide insufficient information of these broader ADM processes for regulatory oversight and assessments of legal compliance. Reviewability involves breaking down the ADM process into technical and organisational elements to provide a systematic framework for determining the contextually appropriate record-keeping mechanisms to facilitate meaningful review - both of individual decisions and of the process as a whole. We argue that a reviewability framework, drawing on administrative law's approach to reviewing human decision-making, offers a practical way forward towards more a more holistic and legally-relevant form of accountability for ADM.",0
"Kearns, Neel, Roth, and Wu [ICML 2018] recently proposed a notion of rich subgroup fairness intended to bridge the gap between statistical and individual notions of fairness. Rich subgroup fairness picks a statistical fairness constraint (say, equalizing false positive rates across protected groups), but then asks that this constraint hold over an exponentially or infinitely large collection of subgroups defined by a class of functions with bounded VC dimension. They give an algorithm guaranteed to learn subject to this constraint, under the condition that it has access to oracles for perfectly learning absent a fairness constraint. In this paper, we undertake an extensive empirical evaluation of the algorithm of Kearns et al. On four real datasets for which fairness is a concern, we investigate the basic convergence of the algorithm when instantiated with fast heuristics in place of learning oracles, measure the tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy, and compare this approach with the recent algorithm of Agarwal, Beygelzeimer, Dudik, Langford, and Wallach [ICML 2018], which implements weaker and more traditional marginal fairness constraints defined by individual protected attributes. We find that in general, the Kearns et al. algorithm converges quickly, large gains in fairness can be obtained with mild costs to accuracy, and that optimizing accuracy subject only to marginal fairness leads to classifiers with substantial subgroup unfairness. We also provide a number of analyses and visualizations of the dynamics and behavior of the Kearns et al. algorithm. Overall we find this algorithm to be effective on real data, and rich subgroup fairness to be a viable notion in practice.",0
"Many machine learning projects for new application areas involve teams of humans who label data for a particular purpose, from hiring crowdworkers to the paper's authors labeling the data themselves. Such a task is quite similar to (or a form of) structured content analysis, which is a longstanding methodology in the social sciences and humanities, with many established best practices. In this paper, we investigate to what extent a sample of machine learning application papers in social computing --- specifically papers from ArXiv and traditional publications performing an ML classification task on Twitter data --- give specific details about whether such best practices were followed. Our team conducted multiple rounds of structured content analysis of each paper, making determinations such as: Does the paper report who the labelers were, what their qualifications were, whether they independently labeled the same items, whether inter-rater reliability metrics were disclosed, what level of training and/or instructions were given to labelers, whether compensation for crowdworkers is disclosed, and if the training data is publicly available. We find a wide divergence in whether such practices were followed and documented. Much of machine learning research and education focuses on what is done once a ""gold standard"" of training data is available, but we discuss issues around the equally-important aspect of whether such data is reliable in the first place.",0
"Representativeness is a foundational yet slippery concept. Though familiar at first blush, it lacks a single precise meaning. Instead, meanings range from typical or characteristic, to a proportionate match between sample and population, to a more general sense of accuracy, generalizability, coverage, or inclusiveness. Moreover, the concept has long been contested. In statistics, debates about the merits and methods of selecting a representative sample date back to the late 19th century; in politics, debates about the value of likeness as a logic of political representation are older still. Today, as the concept crops up in the study of fairness and accountability in machine learning, we need to carefully consider the term's meanings in order to communicate clearly and account for their normative implications. In this paper, we ask what representativeness means, how it is mobilized socially, and what values and ideals it communicates or confronts. We trace the concept's history in statistics and discuss normative tensions concerning its relationship to likeness, exclusion, authority, and aspiration. We draw on these analyses to think through how representativeness is used in FAccT debates, with emphasis on data, shift, participation, and power.",0
"We introduce Fairlearn, an open source toolkit that empowers data scientists and developers to assess and improve the fairness of their AI systems. Fairlearn has two components: an interactive visualization dashboard and unfairness mitigation algorithms. These components are designed to help with navigating trade-offs between fairness and model performance. We emphasize that prioritizing fairness in AI systems is a sociotechnical challenge. Because there are many complex sources of unfairness—some societal and some technical—it is not possible to fully “debias” a system or to guarantee fairness; the goal is to mitigate fairness-related harms as much as possible. As Fairlearn grows to include additional fairness metrics, unfairness mitigation algorithms, and visualization capabilities, we hope that it will be shaped by a diverse community of stakeholders, ranging from data scientists, developers, and business decision makers to the people whose lives may be affected by the predictions of AI systems.",1
"The concept of fairness has recently been applied in machine learning settings to describe a wide range of constraints and objectives. When applied to ranking, recommendation, or subset selection problems for an individual, it becomes less clear that fairness goals are more applicable than goals that prioritize diverse outputs and instances that represent the individual's goals well.  In this work, we discuss the relevance of the concept of fairness to the concepts of diversity and inclusion, and introduce metrics that quantify the diversity and inclusion of an instance or set.  Diversity and inclusion metrics can be used in tandem, including additional fairness constraints, or may be used separately, and we detail how the different metrics interact.  Results from human subject experiments demonstrate that the proposed criteria for diversity and inclusion are consistent with social notions of these two concepts, and human judgments on the diversity and inclusion of example instances are correlated with the defined metrics.",1
"Discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring are an ongoing issue that is a concern not just for workplace relations, but also for wider understandings of economic justice and inequality. The ability to get and keep a job is a key aspect of participating in society and sustaining livelihoods. Yet the way decisions are made on who is eligible for jobs, and why, are rapidly changing with the advent and growth in uptake of automated hiring systems (AHSs) powered by data-driven tools. Evidence of the extent of this uptake around the globe is scarce, but a recent report estimated that 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Applicant Tracking Systems of some kind in their hiring process, a trend driven by perceived efficiency measures and cost-savings. Key concerns about such AHSs include the lack of transparency and potential limitation of access to jobs for specific profiles. In relation to the latter, however, several of these AHSs claim to detect and mitigate discriminatory practices against protected groups and promote diversity and inclusion at work. Yet whilst these tools have a growing user-base around the world, such claims of 'bias mitigation' are rarely scrutinised and evaluated, and when done so, have almost exclusively been from a US socio-legal perspective. In this paper, we introduce a perspective outside the US by critically examining how three prominent automated hiring systems (AHSs) in regular use in the UK, HireVue, Pymetrics and Applied, understand and attempt to mitigate bias and discrimination. These systems have been chosen as they explicitly claim to address issues of discrimination in hiring and, unlike many of their competitors, provide some information about how their systems work that can inform an analysis. Using publicly available documents, we describe how their tools are designed, validated and audited for bias, highlighting assumptions and limitations, before situating these in the socio-legal context of the UK. The UK has a very different legal background to the US in terms not only of hiring and equality law, but also in terms of data protection (DP) law. We argue that this might be important for addressing concerns about transparency and could mean a challenge to building bias mitigation into AHSs definitively capable of meeting EU legal standards. This is significant as these AHSs, especially those developed in the US, may obscure rather than improve systemic discrimination in the workplace.",0
"The recent release of many Chest X-Ray datasets has prompted a lot of interest in radiology report generation. To date, this has been framed as an image captioning task, where the machine takes an RGB image as input and generates a 2-3 sentence summary of findings as output. The quality of these reports has been canonically measured using metrics from the NLP community for language generation such as Machine Translation and Summarization. However, the evaluation metrics (e.g. BLEU, CIDEr) are inappropriate for the medical domain, where clinical correctness is critical. To address this, our team brought together machine learning experts with radiologists for a pilot study in co-designing a better metric for evaluating the quality of an algorithmically-generated radiology report. The interdisciplinary collaborative process involved multiple interviews, outreach, and preliminary annotation to design a larger scale study - which is now underway - to build a more meaningful evaluation tool.",0
"A crucial but often neglected aspect of algorithmic fairness is the question of how we justify enforcing a certain fairness metric from a moral perspective. When fairness metrics are proposed, they are typically argued for by highlighting their mathematical properties. Rarely are the moral assumptions beneath the metric explained. Our aim in this paper is to consider the moral aspects associated with the statistical fairness criterion of independence (statistical parity). To this end, we consider previous work, which discusses the two worldviews ""What You See Is What You Get"" (WYSIWYG) and ""We're All Equal"" (WAE) and by doing so provides some guidance for clarifying the possible assumptions in the design of algorithms. We present an extension of this work, which centers on morality. The most natural moral extension is that independence needs to be fulfilled if and only if differences in predictive features (e.g. high school grades and standardized test scores are predictive of performance at university) between socio-demographic groups are caused by unjust social disparities or measurement errors. Through two counterexamples, we demonstrate that this extension is not universally true. This means that the question of whether independence should be used or not cannot be satisfactorily answered by only considering the justness of differences in the predictive features.",0
"Purpose Use adjudication to quantify errors in diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading based on individual graders and majority decision, and to train an improved automated algorithm for DR grading.",1
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in real-world applications (e.g. facial recognition). This has resulted in concerns about the fairness of decisions made by these models. Various notions and measures of fairness have been proposed to ensure that a decision-making system does not disproportionately harm (or benefit) particular subgroups of the population. In this paper, we argue that traditional notions of fairness that are only based on models' outputs are not sufficient when the model is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We argue that in some cases, it may be easier for an attacker to target a particular subgroup, resulting in a form of robustness bias. We show that measuring robustness bias is a challenging task for DNNs and propose two methods to measure this form of bias. We then conduct an empirical study on state-of-the-art neural networks on commonly used real-world datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Adience, and UTKFace and show that in almost all cases there are subgroups (in some cases based on sensitive attributes like race, gender, etc) which are less robust and are thus at a disadvantage. We argue that this kind of bias arises due to both the data distribution and the highly complex nature of the learned decision boundary in the case of DNNs, thus making mitigation of such biases a non-trivial task. Our results show that robustness bias is an important criterion to consider while auditing real-world systems that rely on DNNs for decision making. Code to reproduce all our results can be found here: https://github.com/nvedant07/Fairness-Through-Robustness",0
"We study the interplay of fairness, welfare, and equity considerations in personalized pricing based on customer features. Sellers are increasingly able to conduct price personalization based on predictive modeling of demand conditional on covariates: setting customized interest rates, targeted discounts of consumer goods, and personalized subsidies of scarce resources with positive externalities like vaccines and bed nets. These different application areas may lead to different concerns around fairness, welfare, and equity on different objectives: price burdens on consumers, price envy, firm revenue, access to a good, equal access, and distributional consequences when the good in question further impacts downstream outcomes of interest. We conduct a comprehensive literature review in order to disentangle these different normative considerations and propose a taxonomy of different objectives with mathematical definitions. We focus on observational metrics that do not assume access to an underlying valuation distribution which is either unobserved due to binary feedback or ill-defined due to overriding behavioral concerns regarding interpreting revealed preferences. In the setting of personalized pricing for the provision of goods with positive benefits, we discuss how price optimization may provide unambiguous benefit by achieving a ""triple bottom line"": personalized pricing enables expanding access, which in turn may lead to gains in welfare due to heterogeneous utility, and improve revenue or budget utilization. We empirically demonstrate the potential benefits of personalized pricing in two settings: pricing subsidies for an elective vaccine, and the effects of personalized interest rates on downstream outcomes in microcredit.",0
"One of the goals of traffic engineering is to achieve a flexible trade-off between fairness and throughput so that users are satisfied with their bandwidth allocation and the network operator is satisfied with the utilization of network resources. In this paper, we propose a novel way to balance the throughput and fairness objectives with linear programming. It allows the network operator to precisely control the trade-off by bounding the fairness degradation for each commodity compared to the max-min fair solution or the throughput degradation compared to the optimal throughput. We also present improvements to a previous algorithm that achieves max-min fairness by solving a series of linear programs. We significantly reduce the number of steps needed when the access rate of commodities is limited. We extend the algorithm to two important practical use cases: importance weights and piece-wise linear utility functions for commodities. Our experiments on synthetic and real networks show that our algorithms achieve a significant speedup and provide practical insights on the trade-off between fairness and throughput.",1
"Extracting structured data from emails can enable several assistive experiences, such as reminding the user when a bill payment is due, answering queries about the departure time of a booked flight, or proactively surfacing an emailed discount coupon while the user is at that store. This paper presents Juicer, a system for extracting information from email that is serving over a billion Gmail users daily. We describe how the design of the system was informed by three key principles: scaling to a planet-wide email service, isolating the complexity to provide a simple experience for the developer, and safeguarding the privacy of users (our team and the developers we support are not allowed to view any single email). We describe the design tradeoffs made in building this system, the challenges faced and the approaches used to tackle them. We present case studies of three extraction tasks implemented on this platformâbill reminders, commercial offers, and hotel reservationsâto illustrate the effectiveness of the platform despite challenges unique to each task. Finally, we outline several areas of ongoing research in large-scale machine-learned information extraction from email.",1
"A growing body of work shows that many problems in fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in machine learning systems are rooted in decisions surrounding the data collection and annotation process. In spite of its fundamental nature however, data collection remains an overlooked part of the machine learning (ML) pipeline. In this paper, we argue that a new specialization should be formed within ML that is focused on methodologies for data collection and annotation: efforts that require institutional frameworks and procedures. Specifically for sociocultural data, parallels can be drawn from archives and libraries. Archives are the longest standing communal effort to gather human information and archive scholars have already developed the language and procedures to address and discuss many challenges pertaining to data collection such as consent, power, inclusivity, transparency, and ethics & privacy. We discuss these five key approaches in document collection practices in archives that can inform data collection in sociocultural ML. By showing data collection practices from another field, we encourage ML research to be more cognizant and systematic in data collection and draw from interdisciplinary expertise.",1
"In this paper, we study counterfactual fairness in text classification, which asks the question: How would the prediction change if the sensitive attribute referenced in the example were different? Toxicity classifiers demonstrate a counterfactual fairness issue by predicting that ""Some people are gay'' is toxic while ""Some people are straight'' is nontoxic. We offer a metric, counterfactual token fairness (CTF), for measuring this particular form of fairness in text classifiers, and describe its relationship with group fairness. Further, we offer three approaches, blindness, counterfactual augmentation, and counterfactual logit pairing (CLP), for optimizing counterfactual token fairness during training, bridging the robustness and fairness literature. Empirically, we find that blindness and CLP address counterfactual token fairness. The methods do not harm classifier performance, and have varying tradeoffs with group fairness. These approaches, both for measurement and optimization, provide a new path forward for addressing fairness concerns in text classification.",1
"Datasets that power machine learning are often used, shared, and reused with little visibility into the processes of deliberation that led to their creation. As artificial intelligence systems are increasingly used in high-stakes tasks, system development and deployment practices must be adapted to address the very real consequences of how model development data is constructed and used in practice. This includes greater transparency about data, and accountability for decisions made when developing it. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous framework for dataset development transparency that supports decision-making and accountability. The framework uses the cyclical, infrastructural and engineering nature of dataset development to draw on best practices from the software development lifecycle. Each stage of the data development lifecycle yields documents that facilitate improved communication and decision-making, as well as drawing attention to the value and necessity of careful data work. The proposed framework makes visible the often overlooked work and decisions that go into dataset creation, a critical step in closing the accountability gap in artificial intelligence and a critical/necessary resource aligned with recent work on auditing processes.",1
"Recent advances in deep learning have achieved impressive gains in classification accuracy on a variety of types of data, including images and text. Despite these gains, however, concerns have been raised about the calibration, robustness, and interpretability of these models. In this paper we propose a simple way to modify any conventional deep architecture to automatically provide more transparent explanations for classification decisions, as well as an intuitive notion of the credibility of each prediction. Specifically, we draw on ideas from nonparametric kernel regression, and propose to predict labels based on a weighted sum of training instances, where the weights are determined by distance in a learned instance-embedding space. Working within the framework of conformal methods, we propose a new measure of nonconformity suggested by our model, and experimentally validate the accompanying theoretical expectations, demonstrating improved transparency, controlled error rates, and robustness to out-of-domain data, without compromising on accuracy or calibration.",0
"There have been several research works proposing new Explainable AI (XAI) methods designed to generate model explanations having specific properties, or desiderata, such as fidelity, robustness, or human-interpretability. However, explanations are seldom evaluated based on their true practical impact on decision-making tasks. Without that assessment, explanations might be chosen that, in fact, hurt the overall performance of the combined system of ML model + end-users. This study aims to bridge this gap by proposing XAI Test, an application-grounded evaluation methodology tailored to isolate the impact of providing the end-user with different levels of information. We conducted an experiment following XAI Test to evaluate three popular XAI methods - LIME, SHAP, and TreeInterpreter - on a real-world fraud detection task, with real data, a deployed ML model, and fraud analysts. During the experiment, we gradually increased the information provided to the fraud analysts in three stages: Data Only, i.e., just transaction data without access to model score nor explanations, Data + ML Model Score, and Data + ML Model Score + Explanations. Using strong statistical analysis, we show that, in general, these popular explainers have a worse impact than desired. Some of the conclusion highlights include: i) showing Data Only results in the highest decision accuracy and the slowest decision time among all variants tested, ii) all the explainers improve accuracy over the Data + ML Model Score variant but still result in lower accuracy when compared with Data Only; iii) LIME was the least preferred by users, probably due to its substantially lower variability of explanations from case to case.",1
"Opportunities such as higher education can promote intergenerational mobility, leading individuals to achieve levels of socioeconomic status above that of their parents. We develop a dynamic model for allocating such opportunities in a society that exhibits bottlenecks in mobility; the problem of optimal allocation reflects a trade-off between the benefits conferred by the opportunities in the current generation and the potential to elevate the socioeconomic status of recipients, shaping the composition of future generations in ways that can benefit further from the opportunities. We show how optimal allocations in our model arise as solutions to continuous optimization problems over multiple generations, and we find in general that these optimal solutions can favor recipients of low socioeconomic status over slightly higher-performing individuals of high socioeconomic status --- a form of socioeconomic affirmative action that the society in our model discovers in the pursuit of purely payoff-maximizing goals. We characterize how the structure of the model can lead to either temporary or persistent affirmative action, and we consider extensions of the model with more complex processes modulating the movement between different levels of socioeconomic status.",0
"Regulatory regimes designed to ensure transparency often struggle to ensure that transparency is meaningful in practice. This challenge is particularly great when coupled with the widespread usage of dark patterns --- design techniques used to manipulate users. The following article analyses the implementation of the transparency provisions of the German Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) by Facebook and Twitter, as well as the consequences of these implementations for the effective regulation of online platforms. This question of effective regulation is particularly salient, due to an enforcement action in 2019 by Germany's Federal Office of Justice (BfJ) against Facebook for what the BfJ claim were insufficient compliance with transparency requirements, under NetzDG. This article provides an overview of the transparency requirements of NetzDG and contrasts these with the transparency requirements of other relevant regulations. It will then discuss how transparency concerns not only providing data, but also how the visibility of the data that is made transparent is managed, by deciding how the data is provided and is framed. We will then provide an empirical analysis of the design choices made by Facebook and Twitter, to assess the ways in which their implementations differ. The consequences of these two divergent implementations on interface design and user behaviour are then discussed, through a comparison of the transparency reports and reporting mechanisms used by Facebook and Twitter. As a next step, we will discuss the BfJ's consideration of the design of Facebook's content reporting mechanisms, and what this reveals about their respective interpretations of NetzDG's scope. Finally, in recognising that this situation is one in which a regulator is considering design as part of their action - we develop a wider argument on the potential for regulatory enforcement around dark patterns, and design practices more generally, for which this case is an early, indicative example.",0
"With the rapidly increasing popularity of deep neural networks for image recognition tasks, a parallel interest in generating adversarial examples to attack the trained models has arisen. To date, these approaches have involved either directly computing gradients with respect to the image pixels or directly solving an optimization on the image pixels. We generalize this pursuit in a novel direction: can a separate network be trained to efficiently attack another fully trained network? We demonstrate that it is possible, and that the generated attacks yield startling insights into the weaknesses of the target network. We call such a network an Adversarial Transformation Network (ATN). ATNs transform any input into an adversarial attack on the target network, while being minimally perturbing to the original inputs and the target networkâs outputs. Further, we show that ATNs are capable of not only causing the target network to make an error, but can be constructed to explicitly control the type of misclassification made. We demonstrate ATNs on both simple MNIST digit classifiers and state-of-the-art ImageNet classifiers deployed by Google, Inc.: Inception ResNet-v2.",1
"We map the recently proposed notions of algorithmic fairness to economic models of Equality of opportunity (EOP)---an extensively studied ideal of fairness in political philosophy. We formally show that through our conceptual mapping, many existing definition of algorithmic fairness, such as predictive value parity and equality of odds, can be interpreted as special cases of EOP. In this respect, our work serves as a unifying moral framework for understanding existing notions of algorithmic fairness. Most importantly, this framework allows us to explicitly spell out the moral assumptions underlying each notion of fairness, and interpret recent fairness impossibility results in a new light. Last but not least and inspired by luck egalitarian models of EOP, we propose a new family of measures for algorithmic fairness. We illustrate our proposal empirically and show that employing a measure of algorithmic (un)fairness when its underlying moral assumptions are not satisfied, can have devastating consequences for the disadvantaged group's welfare.",0
"Data Center topologies employ multiple paths among servers to deliver scalable, cost-effective network capacity. The simplest and the most widely deployed approach for load balancing among these paths, Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP), hashes flows among the shortest paths toward a destination. ECMP leverages uniform hashing of balanced flow sizes to achieve fairness and good load balancing in data centers. However, we show that ECMP further assumes a balanced, regular, and fault-free topology, which are invalid assumptions in practice that can lead to substantial performance degradation and, worse, variation in flow bandwidths even for same size flows.",1
"Philosophers have established that certain ethically important values are modally robust in the sense that they systematically deliver correlative benefits across a range of counterfactual scenarios. In this paper, we contend that recourse - the systematic process of reversing unfavorable decisions by algorithms and bureaucracies across a range of counterfactual scenarios - is such a modally robust good. In particular, we argue that two essential components of a good life - temporally extended agency and trust - are underwritten by recourse. We critique existing approaches to the conceptualization, operationalization and implementation of recourse. Based on these criticisms, we suggest a revised approach to recourse and give examples of how it might be implemented - especially for those who are least well off1.",0
"Data too sensitive to be ""open"" for analysis and re-purposing typically remains ""closed"" as proprietary information. This dichotomy undermines efforts to make algorithmic systems more fair, transparent, and accountable. Access to proprietary data in particular is needed by government agencies to enforce policy, researchers to evaluate methods, and the public to hold agencies accountable; all of these needs must be met while preserving individual privacy and firm competitiveness. In this paper, we describe an integrated legal-technical approach provided by a third-party public-private data trust designed to balance these competing interests. Basic membership allows firms and agencies to enable low-risk access to data for compliance reporting and core methods research, while modular data sharing agreements support a wide array of projects and use cases. Unless specifically stated otherwise in an agreement, all data access is initially provided to end users through customized synthetic datasets that offer a) strong privacy guarantees, b) removal of signals that could expose competitive advantage, and c) removal of biases that could reinforce discriminatory policies, all while maintaining fidelity to the original data. We find that using synthetic data in conjunction with strong legal protections over raw data strikes a balance between transparency, proprietorship, privacy, and research objectives. This legal-technical framework can form the basis for data trusts in a variety of contexts.",0
"While artificial intelligence provides the backbone for many tools people use around the world, recent work has brought to attention that the algorithms powering AI are not free of politics, stereotypes, and bias. While most work in this area has focused on the ways in which AI can exacerbate existing inequalities and discrimination, very little work has studied how governments actively shape training data. We describe how censorship has affected the development of Wikipedia corpuses, text data which are regularly used for pre-trained inputs into NLP algorithms. We show that word embeddings trained on Baidu Baike, an online Chinese encyclopedia, have very different associations between adjectives and a range of concepts about democracy, freedom, collective action, equality, and people and historical events in China than its regularly blocked but uncensored counterpart - Chinese language Wikipedia. We examine the implications of these discrepancies by studying their use in downstream AI applications. Our paper shows how government repression, censorship, and self-censorship may impact training data and the applications that draw from them.",0
"Complex black-box machine learning models are regularly used in critical decision-making domains. This has given rise to several calls for algorithmic explainability. Many explanation algorithms proposed in literature assign importance to each feature individually. However, such explanations fail to capture the joint effects of sets of features. Indeed, few works so far formally analyze high dimensional model explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel high dimension model explanation method that captures the joint effect of feature subsets. We propose a new axiomatization for a generalization of the Banzhaf index; our method can also be thought of as an approximation of a black-box model by a higher-order polynomial. In other words, this work justifies the use of the generalized Banzhaf index as a model explanation by showing that it uniquely satisfies a set of natural desiderata and that it is the optimal local approximation of a black-box model. Our empirical evaluation of our measure highlights how it manages to capture desirable behavior, whereas other measures that do not satisfy our axioms behave in an unpredictable manner.",0
"We examine the way race and racial categories are adopted in algorithmic fairness frameworks. Current methodologies fail to adequately account for the socially constructed nature of race, instead adopting a conceptualization of race as a fixed attribute. Treating race as an attribute, rather than a structural, institutional, and relational phenomenon, can serve to minimize the structural aspects of algorithmic unfairness. In this work, we focus on the history of racial categories and turn to critical race theory and sociological work on race and ethnicity to ground conceptualizations of race for fairness research, drawing on lessons from public health, biomedical research, and social survey research. We argue that algorithmic fairness researchers need to take into account the multidimensionality of race, take seriously the processes of conceptualizing and operationalizing race, focus on social processes which produce racial inequality, and consider perspectives of those most affected by sociotechnical systems.",1
"We often desire our models to be interpretable as well as accurate. Prior work on optimizing models for interpretability has relied on easy-to-quantify proxies for interpretability, such as sparsity or the number of operations required. In this work, we optimize for interpretability by directly including humans in the optimization loop. We develop an algorithm that minimizes the number of user studies to find models that are both predictive and interpretable and demonstrate our approach on several data sets. Our human subjects results show trends towards different proxy notions of interpretability on different datasets, which suggests that different proxies are preferred on different tasks.",1
"Explainable machine learning offers the potential to provide stakeholders with insights into model behavior by using various methods such as feature importance scores, counterfactual explanations, or influential training data. Yet there is little understanding of how organizations use these methods in practice. This study explores how organizations view and use explainability for stakeholder consumption. We find that, currently, the majority of deployments are not for end users affected by the model but rather for machine learning engineers, who use explainability to debug the model itself. There is thus a gap between explainability in practice and the goal of transparency, since explanations primarily serve internal stakeholders rather than external ones. Our study synthesizes the limitations of current explainability techniques that hamper their use for end users. To facilitate end user interaction, we develop a framework for establishing clear goals for explainability. We end by discussing concerns raised regarding explainability.",1
"Detecting biases in artificial intelligence has become difficult because of the impenetrable nature of deep learning. The central difficulty is in relating unobservable phenomena deep inside models with observable, outside quantities that we can measure from inputs and outputs. For example, can we detect gendered perceptions of occupations (e.g., female librarian, male electrician) using questions to and answers from a word embedding-based system? Current techniques for detecting biases are often customized for a task, dataset, or method, affecting their generalization. In this work, we draw from Psychophysics in Experimental Psychology---meant to relate quantities from the real world (i.e., ""Physics"") into subjective measures in the mind (i.e., ""Psyche"")---to propose an intellectually coherent and generalizable framework to detect biases in AI. Specifically, we adapt the two-alternative forced choice task (2AFC) to estimate potential biases and the strength of those biases in black-box models. We successfully reproduce previously-known biased perceptions in word embeddings and sentiment analysis predictions. We discuss how concepts in experimental psychology can be naturally applied to understanding artificial mental phenomena, and how psychophysics can form a useful methodological foundation to study fairness in AI.",0
"Although essential to revealing biased performance, well intentioned attempts at algorithmic auditing can have effects that may harm the very populations these measures are meant to protect. This concern is even more salient while auditing biometric systems such as facial recognition, where the data is sensitive and the technology is often used in ethically questionable manners. We demonstrate a set of five ethical concerns in the particular case of auditing commercial facial processing technology, highlighting additional design considerations and ethical tensions the auditor needs to be aware of so as not exacerbate or complement the harms propagated by the audited system. We go further to provide tangible illustrations of these concerns, and conclude by reflecting on what these concerns mean for the role of the algorithmic audit and the fundamental product limitations they reveal.",1
"The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy implications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical records or other personal information. To address those concerns, one promising approach is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which transfers to a ""student"" model the knowledge of an ensemble of ""teacher"" models, with intuitive privacy provided by training teachers on disjoint data and strong privacy guaranteed by noisy aggregation of teachersâ answers. However, PATE has so far been evaluated only on simple classification tasks like MNIST, leaving unclear its utility when applied to larger-scale learning tasks and real-world datasets.",1
"Large-scale datasets may contain significant proportions of noisy (incorrect) class labels, and it is well-known that modern deep neural networks (DNNs) poorly generalize from such noisy training datasets. To mitigate the issue, we propose a novel inference method, termed Robust Generative classifier (RoG), applicable to any discriminative (e.g., softmax) neural classifier pre-trained on noisy datasets. In particular, we induce a generative classifier on top of hidden feature spaces of the pre-trained DNNs, for obtaining a more robust decision boundary. By estimating the parameters of generative classifier using the minimum covariance determinant estimator, we significantly improve the classification accuracy with neither re-training of the deep model nor changing its architectures. With the assumption of Gaussian distribution for features, we prove that RoG generalizes better than baselines under noisy labels. Finally, we propose the ensemble version of RoG to improve its performance by investigating the layer-wise characteristics of DNNs. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RoG given different learning models optimized by several training techniques to handle diverse scenarios of noisy labels.",1
"There is a recent surge of papers that focus on attention as explanation of model predictions, giving mixed evidence on whether attention can be used as such. This has led some to try and `improve' attention so as to make it more interpretable. We argue that we should pay attention no heed. While attention conveniently gives us one weight per input token and is easily extracted, it is often unclear towards what goal it is used as explanation. We argue that often that goal, whether explicitly stated or not, is to find out what input tokens are the most relevant to a prediction. When that is the case, input saliency methods better suit our needs, and there are no compelling reasons to use attention, despite the coincidence that it provides a weight for each input. With this position paper, we hope to shift some of the recent focus on attention to saliency methods, and for authors to clearly state the goal for their explanations.",1
"Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life. In higher education, machine-learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions. Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems, fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses. The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM. That is, algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but, rather, reproduce biases existing within the respective training data. This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness. Specifically, we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness: (i) procedural fairness and (ii) distributive fairness. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 304) from a large German university, we tested whether students' assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs. human decision-making (HDM) within the higher education context. Furthermore, we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables, which are hugely important for universities: (1) exit, (2) voice, and (3) organizational reputation. The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness. Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions, we find that (1) distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system, whereas (2) only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting. Finally, (3) distributive fairness, but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation. For universities aiming to implement ADM systems, it is crucial, therefore, to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account.",0
"Explanations in Machine Learning come in many forms, but a consensus regarding their desired properties is yet to emerge. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy and a set of descriptors that can be used to characterise and systematically assess explainable systems along five key dimensions: functional, operational, usability, safety and validation. In order to design a comprehensive and representative taxonomy and associated descriptors we surveyed the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence literature, extracting the criteria and desiderata that other authors have proposed or implicitly used in their research. The survey includes papers introducing new explainability algorithms to see what criteria are used to guide their development and how these algorithms are evaluated, as well as papers proposing such criteria from both computer science and social science perspectives. This novel framework allows to systematically compare and contrast explainability approaches, not just to better understand their capabilities but also to identify discrepancies between their theoretical qualities and properties of their implementations. We developed an operationalisation of the framework in the form of Explainability Fact Sheets, which enable researchers and practitioners alike to quickly grasp capabilities and limitations of a particular explainable method. When used as a Work Sheet, our taxonomy can guide the development of new explainability approaches by aiding in their critical evaluation along the five proposed dimensions.",0
"Computers are increasingly used to make decisions that have significant impact on people's lives. Often, these predictions can affect different population subgroups disproportionately. As a result, the issue of fairness has received much recent interest, and a number of fairness-enhanced classifiers have appeared in the literature. This paper seeks to study the following questions: how do these different techniques fundamentally compare to one another, and what accounts for the differences? Specifically, we seek to bring attention to many under-appreciated aspects of such fairness-enhancing interventions that require investigation for these algorithms to receive broad adoption. We present the results of an open benchmark we have developed that lets us compare a number of different algorithms under a variety of fairness measures and existing datasets. We find that although different algorithms tend to prefer specific formulations of fairness preservations, many of these measures strongly correlate with one another. In addition, we find that fairness-preserving algorithms tend to be sensitive to fluctuations in dataset composition (simulated in our benchmark by varying training-test splits) and to different forms of preprocessing, indicating that fairness interventions might be more brittle than previously thought.",0
"As machine learning is increasingly used to inform consequential decision-making (e.g., pre-trial bail and loan approval), it becomes important to explain how the system arrived at its decision, and also suggest actions to achieve a favorable decision. Counterfactual explanations -""how the world would have (had) to be different for a desirable outcome to occur""- aim to satisfy these criteria. Existing works have primarily focused on designing algorithms to obtain counterfactual explanations for a wide range of settings. However, it has largely been overlooked that ultimately, one of the main objectives is to allow people to act rather than just understand. In layman's terms, counterfactual explanations inform an individual where they need to get to, but not how to get there. In this work, we rely on causal reasoning to caution against the use of counterfactual explanations as a recommendable set of actions for recourse. Instead, we propose a shift of paradigm from recourse via nearest counterfactual explanations to recourse through minimal interventions, shifting the focus from explanations to interventions.",0
"Controversies around race and machine learning have sparked debate among computer scientists over how to design machine learning systems that guarantee fairness. These debates rarely engage with how racial identity is embedded in our social experience, making for sociological and psychological complexity. This complexity challenges the paradigm of considering fairness to be a formal property of supervised learning with respect to protected personal attributes. Racial identity is not simply a personal subjective quality. For people labeled ""Black"" it is an ascribed political category that has consequences for social differentiation embedded in systemic patterns of social inequality achieved through both social and spatial segregation. In the United States, racial classification can best be understood as a system of inherently unequal status categories that places whites as the most privileged category while signifying the Negro/black category as stigmatized. Social stigma is reinforced through the unequal distribution of societal rewards and goods along racial lines that is reinforced by state, corporate, and civic institutions and practices. This creates a dilemma for society and designers: be blind to racial group disparities and thereby reify racialized social inequality by no longer measuring systemic inequality, or be conscious of racial categories in a way that itself reifies race. We propose a third option. By preceding group fairness interventions with unsupervised learning to dynamically detect patterns of segregation, machine learning systems can mitigate the root cause of social disparities, social segregation and stratification, without further anchoring status categories of disadvantage.",0
"With the aim of building machine learning systems that incorporate standards of fairness and accountability, we explore explicit subgroup sample complexity bounds. The work is motivated by the observation that classifier predictions for real world datasets often demonstrate drastically different metrics, such as accuracy, when subdivided by specific sensitive variable subgroups.  The reasons for these discrepancies are varied and not limited to the influence of mitigating variables, institutional bias, underlying population distributions as well as selection bias. Among the numerous definitions of fairness that exist, we argue that at a minimum, principled ML practices should ensure that classification predictions are able to mirror the underlying sub-population distributions as a prelude to bias mitigation, and not amplify discrepancies due to sampling/selection bias. However, as the number of sensitive variables grow, populations meeting at the intersectionality of these variables may simply not exist or be large enough to accurately sample from. In theses increasingly likely scenarios, the case for human intervention and applying situational and individual definitions of fairness should be made..    In this paper we explore, setting Pareto-efficient subgroup sample complexity lower bounds based on the complexity of the ML classifier using VC dimension and Rademacher complexity.  We demonstrate that for a classifier to approach a definition of fairness in terms of specific sensitive variables, adequate subgroup population samples need to exist and the model dimensionality has to be aligned with subgroup population distributions.  In cases where this is not feasible human intervention is explored.  We look at two commonly explored UCI datasets under this lens.",1
"How can we build more just machine learning systems? To answer this question, we need to know both what justice is and how to tell whether one system is more or less just than another. That is, we need both a definition and a measure of justice. Theories of distributive justice hold that justice can be measured (in part) in terms of the fair distribution of benefits and burdens across people in society. Recently, the field known as fair machine learning has turned to John Rawls's theory of distributive justice for inspiration and operationalization. However, philosophers known as capability theorists have long argued that Rawls's theory uses the wrong measure of justice, thereby encoding biases against people with disabilities. If these theorists are right, is it possible to operationalize Rawls's theory in machine learning systems without also encoding its biases? In this paper, I draw on examples from fair machine learning to suggest that the answer to this question is no: the capability theorists' arguments against Rawls's theory carry over into machine learning systems. But capability theorists don't only argue that Rawls's theory uses the wrong measure, they also offer an alternative measure. Which measure of justice is right? And has fair machine learning been using the wrong one?",0
"Although computer scientists are eager to help address social problems, the field faces a growing awareness that many well-intentioned applications of algorithms in social contexts have led to significant harm. We argue that addressing this gap between the field's desire to do good and the harmful impacts of many of its interventions requires looking to the epistemic and methodological underpinnings of algorithms. We diagnose the dominant mode of algorithmic reasoning as ""algorithmic formalism"" and describe how formalist orientations lead to harmful algorithmic interventions. Addressing these harms requires pursuing a new mode of algorithmic thinking that is attentive to the internal limits of algorithms and to the social concerns that fall beyond the bounds of algorithmic formalism. To understand what a methodological evolution beyond formalism looks like and what it may achieve, we turn to the twentieth century evolution in American legal thought from legal formalism to legal realism. Drawing on the lessons of legal realism, we propose a new mode of algorithmic thinking---""algorithmic realism""---that provides tools for computer scientists to account for the realities of social life and of algorithmic impacts. These realist approaches, although not foolproof, will better equip computer scientists to reduce algorithmic harms and to reason well about doing good.",0
"The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.",1
"Resource allocation problems are a fundamental domain in which to evaluate the fairness properties of algorithms. The trade-offs between fairness and utilization have a long history in this domain. A recent line of work has considered fairness questions for resource allocation when the demands for the resource are distributed across multiple groups and drawn from probability distributions. In such cases, a natural fairness requirement is that individuals from different groups should have (approximately) equal probabilities of receiving the resource. A largely open question in this area has been to bound the gap between the maximum possible utilization of the resource and the maximum possible utilization subject to this fairness condition. Here, we obtain some of the first provable upper bounds on this gap. We obtain an upper bound for arbitrary distributions, as well as much stronger upper bounds for specific families of distributions that are typically used to model levels of demand. In particular, we find --- somewhat surprisingly --- that there are natural families of distributions (including Exponential and Weibull) for which the gap is non-existent: it is possible to simultaneously achieve maximum utilization and the given notion of fairness. Finally, we show that for power-law distributions, there is a non-trivial gap between the solutions, but this gap can be bounded by a constant factor independent of the parameters of the distribution.",0
"Accountability is an often called for property of technical systems. It is a requirement for algorithmic decision systems, autonomous cyber-physical systems, and for software systems in general. As a concept, accountability goes back to the early history of Liberalism and is suggested as a tool to limit the use of power. This long history has also given us many, often slightly differing, definitions of accountability. The problem that software developers now face is to understand what accountability means for their systems and how to reflect it in a system's design. To enable the rigorous study of accountability in a system, we need models that are suitable for capturing such a varied concept. In this paper, we present a method to express and compare different definitions of accountability using Structural Causal Models. We show how these models can be used to evaluate a system's design and present a small use case based on an autonomous car.",0
"Motivated by the extensive documented disparate harms of artificial intelligence (AI), many recent practitioner-facing reflective tools have been created to promote responsible AI development. However, the use of such tools internally by technology development firms addresses responsible AI as an issue of closed-door compliance rather than a matter of public concern. Recent advocate and activist efforts intervene in AI as a public policy problem, inciting a growing number of cities to pass bans or other ordinances on AI and surveillance technologies. In support of this broader ecology of political actors, we present a set of reflective tools intended to increase public participation in technology advocacy for AI policy action. To this end, the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit (the AEKit) provides a practical policy-facing definition of AI, a flowchart for assessing technologies against that definition, a worksheet for decomposing AI systems into constituent parts, and a list of probing questions that can be posed to vendors, policy-makers, or government agencies. The AEKit carries an action-orientation towards political encounters between community groups in the public and their representatives, opening up the work of AI reflection and remediation to multiple points of intervention. Unlike current reflective tools available to practitioners, our toolkit carries with it a politics of community participation and activism.",0
"Algorithmic systems increasingly shape information people are exposed to as well as influence decisions about employment, finances, and other opportunities. In some cases, algorithmic systems may be more or less favorable to certain groups or individuals, sparking substantial discussion of algorithmic fairness in public policy circles, academia, and the press. We broaden this discussion by exploring how members of potentially affected communities feel about algorithmic fairness. We conducted workshops and interviews with 44 participants from several populations traditionally marginalized by categories of race or class in the United States. While the concept of algorithmic fairness was largely unfamiliar, learning about algorithmic (un)fairness elicited negative feelings that connect to current national discussion about racial injustice and economic inequality. In addition to their concerns about potential harms to themselves and society, participants also indicated that algorithmic fairness (or lack thereof) could substantially affect their trust in a company or product.",1
"To help their users to discover important items at a particular time, major websites like Twitter, Yelp, TripAdvisor or NYTimes provide Top-K recommendations (e.g., 10 Trending Topics, Top 5 Hotels in Paris or 10 Most Viewed News Stories), which rely on crowdsourced popularity signals to select the items. However, different sections of a crowd may have different preferences, and there is a large silent majority who do not explicitly express their opinion. Also, the crowd often consists of actors like bots, spammers, or people running orchestrated campaigns. Recommendation algorithms today largely do not consider such nuances, hence are vulnerable to strategic manipulation by small but hyper-active user groups. To fairly aggregate the preferences of all users while recommending top-K items, we borrow ideas from prior research on social choice theory, and identify a voting mechanism called Single Transferable Vote (STV) as having many of the fairness properties we desire in top-K item (s)elections. We develop an innovative mechanism to attribute preferences of silent majority which also make STV completely operational. We show the generalizability of our approach by implementing it on two different real-world datasets. Through extensive experimentation and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, we show that our proposed approach provides maximum user satisfaction, and cuts down drastically on items disliked by most but hyper-actively promoted by a few users.",0
"Past research shows that users benefit from systems that support them in their writing and exploration tasks. The autosuggestion feature of Web search engines is an example of such a system: It helps users in formulating their queries by offering a list of suggestions as they type. Autosuggestions are typically generated by machine learning (ML) systems trained on a corpus of search logs and document representations. Such automated methods can become prone to issues that result in problematic suggestions that are biased, racist, sexist or in other ways inappropriate. While current search engines have become increasingly proficient at suppressing such problematic suggestions, there are still persistent issues that remain. In this paper, we reflect on past efforts and on why certain issues still linger by covering explored solutions along a prototypical pipeline for identifying, detecting, and addressing problematic autosuggestions. To showcase their complexity, we discuss several dimensions of problematic suggestions, difficult issues along the pipeline, and why our discussion applies to the increasing number of applications beyond web search that implement similar textual suggestion features. By outlining persistent social and technical challenges in moderating web search suggestions, we provide a renewed call for action.",1
"This paper introduces a novel dataset to help researchers evaluate their computer vision and audio models for accuracy across a diverse set of age, genders, apparent skin tones and ambient lighting conditions. Our dataset is composed of 3,011 subjects and contains over 45,000 videos, with an average of 15 videos per person. The videos were recorded in multiple U.S. states with a diverse set of adults in various age, gender and apparent skin tone groups. A key feature is that each subject agreed to participate for their likenesses to be used. Additionally, our age and gender annotations are provided by the subjects themselves. A group of trained annotators labeled the subjects’ apparent skin tone using the Fitzpatrick skin type scale. Moreover, annotations for videos recorded in low ambient lighting are also provided. As an application to measure robustness of predictions across certain attributes, we provide a comprehensive study on the top five winners of the DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC). Experimental evaluation shows that the winning models are less performant on some specific groups of people, such as subjects with darker skin tones and thus may not generalize to all people. In addition, we also evaluate the state-of-the-art apparent age and gender classification methods. Our experiments provides a through analysis on these models in terms of fair treatment of people from various backgrounds.",1
"As more researchers have become aware of and passionate about algorithmic fairness, there has been an explosion in papers laying out new metrics, suggesting algorithms to address issues, and calling attention to issues in existing applications of machine learning. This research has greatly expanded our understanding of the concerns and challenges in deploying machine learning, but there has been much less work in seeing how the rubber meets the road. ",1
"As calls for fair and unbiased algorithmic systems increase, so too does the number of individuals working on algorithmic fairness in industry. However, these practitioners often do not have access to the demographic data they feel they need to detect bias in practice. Even with the growing variety of toolkits and strategies for working towards algorithmic fairness, they almost invariably require access to demographic attributes or proxies. We investigated this dilemma through semi-structured interviews with 38 practitioners and professionals either working in or adjacent to algorithmic fairness. Participants painted a complex picture of what demographic data availability and use look like on the ground, ranging from not having access to personal data of any kind to being legally required to collect and use demographic data for discrimination assessments. In many domains, demographic data collection raises a host of difficult questions, including how to balance privacy and fairness, how to define relevant social categories, how to ensure meaningful consent, and whether it is appropriate for private companies to infer someone's demographics. Our research suggests challenges that must be considered by businesses, regulators, researchers, and community groups in order to enable practitioners to address algorithmic bias in practice. Critically, we do not propose that the overall goal of future work should be to simply lower the barriers to collecting demographic data. Rather, our study surfaces a swath of normative questions about how, when, and whether this data should be procured, and, in cases where it is not, what should still be done to mitigate bias.",1
"Risk assessments have proliferated in the United States criminal justice system. The theory of change motivating their adoption involves two key assumptions: first, that risk assessments will reduce human biases by making objective decisions, and second, that risk assessments will promote criminal justice reform. In this paper I interrogate both of these assumptions, concluding that risk assessments are an ill-advised tool for challenging the centrality and legitimacy of incarceration within the criminal justice system. First, risk assessments fail to provide objectivity, as their use creates numerous sites of discretion. Second, risk assessments provide no guarantee of reducing incarceration; instead, they risk legitimizing the criminal justice system's structural racism. I then consider, via an ""epistemic reform,"" the path forward for criminal justice reform. I reinterpret recent results regarding the ""impossibility of fairness"" as not simply a tension between mathematical metrics but as evidence of a deeper tension between notions of equality. This expanded frame challenges the formalist, colorblind proceduralism at the heart of the criminal justice system and suggests a more structural approach to reform. Together, this analysis highlights how algorithmic fairness narrows the scope of judgments about justice and how ""fair"" algorithms can reinforce discrimination.",0
"The desire to use machine learning to assist in human decision making has spawned a large area of research in understanding the impact of such systems not only on the society as a whole, but also the specific impact on different subpopulations. Recent work has shown that  while there are several natural ways to quantify the fairness of a particular system, none of them are universal, and except for trivial cases, satisfying one means violating another~\citet&lbrace;Kleinberg, Goel, Kleinberg2&rbrace;.

"Assessing the fairness of a decision making system with respect to a protected class, such as gender or race, is challenging when class membership labels are unavailable. Probabilistic models for predicting the protected class based on observable proxies, such as surname and geolocation for race, are sometimes used to impute these missing labels for compliance assessments. Empirically, these methods are observed to exaggerate disparities, but the reason why is unknown. In this paper, we decompose the biases in estimating outcome disparity via threshold-based imputation into multiple interpretable bias sources, allowing us to explain when over- or underestimation occurs. We also propose an alternative weighted estimator that uses soft classification, and show that its bias arises simply from the conditional covariance of the outcome with the true class membership. Finally, we illustrate our results with numerical simulations and a public dataset of mortgage applications, using geolocation as a proxy for race. We confirm that the bias of threshold-based imputation is generally upward, but its magnitude varies strongly with the threshold chosen. Our new weighted estimator tends to have a negative bias that is much simpler to analyze and reason about.",0
"Datasets often contain biases which unfairly disadvantage certain groups, and classifiers trained on such datasets can inherit these biases. In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation of how this bias can arise. We do so by assuming the existence of underlying, unknown, and unbiased labels which are overwritten by an agent who intends to provide accurate labels but may have biases against certain groups. Despite the fact that we only observe the biased labels, we are able to show that the bias may nevertheless be corrected by re-weighting the data points without changing the labels. We show, with theoretical guarantees, that training on the re-weighted dataset corresponds to training on the unobserved but unbiased labels, thus leading to an unbiased machine learning classifier. Our procedure is fast and robust and can be used with virtually any learning algorithm. We evaluate on a number of standard machine learning fairness datasets and a variety of fairness notions, finding that our method outperforms standard approaches in achieving fair classification.",1
"Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) forms a fundamental building block in many applications for learning over sensitive data. Two standard approaches, privacy amplification by subsampling, and privacy amplification by shuffling, permit adding lower noise in DP-SGD than via na\""&lbrace;\i&rbrace;ve schemes. A key assumption in both these approaches is that the elements in the data set can be uniformly sampled, or be uniformly permuted ---  constraints that may become prohibitive when the data is processed in a decentralized or distributed fashion. In this paper, we focus on conducting iterative methods like DP-SGD in the setting of federated learning (FL) wherein the data is distributed among many devices (clients). Our main contribution is the random check-in distributed protocol, which crucially relies only on randomized participation decisions made locally and independently by each client. It has privacy/accuracy trade-offs similar to privacy amplification by subsampling/shuffling. However, our method does not require server-initiated communication, or even knowledge of the population size. To our knowledge, this is the first privacy amplification tailored for a distributed learning framework, and it may have broader applicability beyond FL. Along the way, we extend privacy amplification by shuffling to incorporate $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP local randomizers, and exponentially improve its guarantees. In practical regimes, this improvement allows for similar privacy and utility using data from an order of magnitude fewer users.",1
"Smart weight scales offer bioimpedance-based body composition analysis as a supplement to pure body weight measurement. Companies such as Withings and Fitbit tout composition analysis as providing self-knowledge and the ability to make more informed decisions. However, these aspirational statements elide the reality that these numbers are a product of proprietary regression equations that require a binary sex/gender as their input. Our paper combines transgender studies-influenced personal narrative with an analysis of the scientific basis of bioimpedance technology used as part of the Withings smart scale. Attempting to include nonbinary people reveals that bioelectrical impedance analysis has always rested on physiologically shaky ground. White nonbinary people are merely the tip of the iceberg of those who may find that their smart scale is not so intelligent when it comes to their bodies. Using body composition analysis as an example, we explore how the problem of trans and nonbinary inclusion in personal health tech goes beyond the issues of adding a third ""gender"" box or slapping a rainbow flag on the packaging. We also provide recommendations as to how to approach creating more inclusive technologies even while still relying on exclusionary data.",0
"We investigate machine learning models that can provide diminishing returns and accelerating returns guarantees to capture prior knowledge or policies about how outputs should depend on inputs. We show that one can build flexible, nonlinear, multi-dimensional models using lattice functions with any combination of concavity/convexity and monotonicity constraints on any subsets of features, and compare to new shape-constrained neural networks. We demonstrate on real-world examples that these shape constrained models can provide tuning-free regularization and improve model understandability.",1
"As awareness of the potential for learned models to amplify existing societal biases increases, the field of ML fairness has developed mitigation techniques. A prevalent method applies constraints, including equality of performance, with respect to subgroups defined over the intersection of sensitive attributes such as race and gender. Enforcing such constraints when the subgroup populations are considerably skewed with respect to a target can lead to unintentional degradation in performance, without benefiting any individual subgroup, counter to the United Nations Sustainable Development goals of reducing inequalities and promoting growth. In order to avoid such performance degradation while ensuring equitable treatment to all groups, we propose Pareto-Efficient Fairness (PEF), which identifies the operating point on the Pareto curve of subgroup performances closest to the fairness hyperplane. Specifically, PEF finds a Pareto Optimal point which maximizes multiple subgroup accuracy measures. The algorithm scalarizes using the adaptive weighted metric norm by iteratively searching the Pareto region of all models enforcing the fairness constraint. PEF is backed by strong theoretical results on discoverability and provides domain practitioners finer control in navigating both convex and non-convex accuracyfairness trade-offs. Empirically, we show that PEF increases performance of all subgroups in skewed synthetic data and UCI datasets.",1
"To improve real-world applications of machine learning, experienced practitioners develop intuition about their datasets, their models, and how the two interact. Manual inspection of raw data - of representative samples, of outliers, of misclassifications, or alike - is an essential tool in a) identifying and fixing problems in the data, b) generating new modeling hypotheses, and c) assigning human-provided labels. However, manual data inspection is risky for privacy-sensitive datasets, such as those representing the behavior of real-world individuals. Furthermore, manual data inspection is impossible in the increasingly important setting of federated learning, where raw examples are stored at the edge and the  practitioner may only access aggregated outputs such as metrics or model parameters. This paper outlines a research agenda to address data-oriented tooling needs of ML practitioners who work with privacy-sensitive or decentralized datasets. We demonstrate that generative models - trained using federated methods and with formal differential privacy guarantees - can be used to effectively debug data issues even when the data cannot be directly inspected.",1
"Concept-based explanations can be a key direction to understand how DNNs make decisions. In this paper, we study concept-based explainability in a systematic framework. First, we define the notion of completeness, which quantifies how sufficient a particular set of concepts is in explaining the model's behavior. Based on performance and variability motivations, we propose two definitions to quantify completeness. We show that they yield the commonly-used PCA method under certain assumptions. Next, we study two additional constraints to ensure the interpretability of discovered concept, based on sparsity principles. Through systematic experiments, on specifically-designed synthetic dataset and real-world text and image datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework in finding concepts that are complete (in explaining the decision) and that are interpretable.",1
"Automated systems for detecting harmful social media content are afflicted by a variety of biases, some of which originate in their training datasets. In particular, some systems have been shown to propagate racial dialect bias: they systematically classify content aligned with the African American English (AAE) dialect as harmful at a higher rate than content aligned with White English (WE). This perpetuates prejudice by silencing the Black community. Towards this problem we adapt and apply two existing bias mitigation approaches: preferential sampling pre-processing and adversarial debiasing in-processing. We analyse the impact of our interventions on model performance and propagated bias. We find that when bias mitigation is employed, a high degree of predictive accuracy is maintained relative to baseline, and in many cases bias against AAE in harmful tweet predictions is reduced. However, the specific effects of these interventions on bias and performance vary widely between dataset contexts. This variation suggests the unpredictability of autonomous harmful content detection outside of its development context. We argue that this, and the low performance of these systems at baseline, raise questions about the reliability and role of such systems in high-impact, real-world settings.",0
"The University of California suspended through 2024 the requirement that applicants from California submit SAT scores, upending the major role standardized testing has played in college admissions. We study the impact of such decisions and its interplay with other policies---such as affirmative action---on admitted class composition. This paper considers a theoretical framework to study the effect of requiring test scores on academic merit and diversity in college admissions. The model has a college and set of potential students. Each student has observed application components and group membership, as well as an unobserved noisy skill level generated from an observed distribution. The college is Bayesian and maximizes an objective that depends on both diversity and merit. It estimates each applicant's true skill level using the observed features and potentially their group membership, and then admits students with or without affirmative action. We characterize the trade-off between the (potentially positive) informational role of standardized testing in college admissions and its (negative) exclusionary nature. Dropping test scores may exacerbate disparities by decreasing the amount of information available for each applicant, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds. However, if there are substantial barriers to testing, removing the test improves both academic merit and diversity by increasing the size of the applicant pool. Finally, using application and transcript data from the University of Texas at Austin, we demonstrate how an admissions committee could measure the trade-off in practice to better decide whether to drop their test scores requirement.

"As machine learning models are increasingly used for high-stakes decision making, scholars have sought to intervene to ensure that such models do not encode undesirable social and political values. However, little attention thus far has been given to how values influence the machine learning discipline as a whole. How do values influence what the discipline focuses on and the way it develops? If undesirable values are at play at the level of the discipline, then intervening on particular models will not suffice to address the problem. Instead, interventions at the disciplinary-level are required. This paper analyzes the discipline of machine learning through the lens of philosophy of science. We develop a conceptual framework to evaluate the process through which types of machine learning models (e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, graphical models) become predominant. The rise and fall of model-types is often framed as objective progress. However, such disciplinary shifts are more nuanced. First, we argue that the rise of a model-type is self-reinforcing-it influences the way model-types are evaluated. For example, the rise of deep learning was entangled with a greater focus on evaluations in compute-rich and data-rich environments. Second, the way model-types are evaluated encodes loaded social and political values. For example, a greater focus on evaluations in compute-rich and data-rich environments encodes values about centralization of power, privacy, and environmental concerns.",0
"DeConvNet, Guided BackProp, LRP, were invented to better understand deep neural networks. We show that these methods do not produce the theoretically correct explanation for a linear model. Yet they are used on multi-layer networks with millions of parameters. This is a cause for concern since linear models are simple neural networks. We argue that explanation methods for neural nets should work reliably in the limit of  simplicity, the linear models. Based on our analysis of linear models we propose a generalization that yields two explanation techniques (PatternNet and PatternAttribution) that are theoretically sound for linear models and produce improved explanations for deep networks.",1
"Data-driven statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques leverage large amounts of language data to build models that can understand language. However, most language data reflect the public discourse at the time the data was produced, and hence NLP models are susceptible to learning incidental associations around named referents at a particular point in time, in addition to general linguistic meaning. An NLP system designed to model notions such as sentiment and toxicity should ideally produce scores that are independent of the identity of such entities mentioned in text and their social associations. For example, in a general purpose sentiment analysis system, a phrase such as I hate Katy Perry should be interpreted as having the same sentiment as I hate Taylor Swift. Based on this idea, we propose a generic evaluation framework, Perturbation Sensitivity Analysis, which detects unintended model biases related to named entities, and requires no new annotations or corpora. We demonstrate the utility of this analysis by employing it on two different NLP models --- a sentiment model and a toxicity model --- applied on online comments in English language from four different genres.",1
"Post-hoc explanations of machine learning models are crucial for people to understand and act on algorithmic predictions. An intriguing class of explanations is through counterfactuals, hypothetical examples that show people how to obtain a different prediction. We posit that effective counterfactual explanations should satisfy two properties: feasibility of the counterfactual actions given user context and constraints, and diversity among the counterfactuals presented. To this end, we propose a framework for generating and evaluating a diverse set of counterfactual explanations based on determinantal point processes. To evaluate the actionability of counterfactuals, we provide metrics that enable comparison of counterfactual-based methods to other local explanation methods. We further address necessary tradeoffs and point to causal implications in optimizing for counterfactuals. Our experiments on four real-world datasets show that our framework can generate a set of counterfactuals that are diverse and well approximate local decision boundaries, outperforming prior approaches to generating diverse counterfactuals. We provide an implementation of the framework at https://github.com/microsoft/DiCE.",1
"Quantitative definitions of what is unfair and what is fair have been introduced in multiple disciplines for well over 50 years, including in education, hiring, and machine learning. We trace how the notion of fairness has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression). This work points the way towards future research and measurement of (un)fairness that builds from our modern understanding of fairness while incorporating insights from the past.",1
"We show that the popular k-means clustering algorithm (Lloyd's heuristic), used for a variety of scientific data, can result in outcomes that are unfavorable to subgroups of data (e.g., demographic groups). Such biased clusterings can have deleterious implications for human-centric applications such as resource allocation. We present a fair k-means objective and algorithm to choose cluster centers that provide equitable costs for different groups. The algorithm, Fair-Lloyd, is a modification of Lloyd's heuristic for k-means, inheriting its simplicity, efficiency, and stability. In comparison with standard Lloyd's, we find that on benchmark datasets, Fair-Lloyd exhibits unbiased performance by ensuring that all groups have equal costs in the output k-clustering, while incurring a negligible increase in running time, thus making it a viable fair option wherever k-means is currently used.",0
"In this paper, we study the prediction of a real-valued target, such as a risk score or recidivism rate, while guaranteeing a quantitative notion of fairness with respect to a protected attribute such as gender or race. We call this class of problems fair regression. We propose general schemes for fair regression under two notions of fairness: (1) statistical parity, which asks that the prediction be statistically independent of the protected attribute, and (2) bounded group loss, which asks that the prediction error restricted to any protected group remain below some pre-determined level. While we only study these two notions of fairness, our schemes are applicable to arbitrary Lipschitz-continuous losses, and so they encompass least-squares regression, logistic regression, quantile regression, and many other tasks. Our schemes only require access to standard risk minimization algorithms (such as standard classification or least-squares regression) while providing theoretical guarantees on the optimality and fairness of the obtained solutions. In addition to analyzing theoretical properties of our schemes, we empirically demonstrate their ability to uncover fairness–accuracy frontiers on several standard datasets.",1
"The goal of this paper is to advance design, policy, and ethics scholarship on how engineers and regulators can protect consumers from deceptive robots and artificial intelligences that exhibit the problem of dishonest anthropomorphism. The analysis expands upon ideas surrounding the principle of honest anthropomorphism originally formulated by Margot Kaminsky, Mathew Ruben, William D. Smart, and Cindy M. Grimm in their groundbreaking Maryland Law Review article, ""Averting Robot Eyes."" Applying boundary management theory and philosophical insights into prediction and perception, we create a new taxonomy that identifies fundamental types of dishonest anthropomorphism and pinpoints harms that they can cause. To demonstrate how the taxonomy can be applied as well as clarify the scope of the problems that it can cover, we critically consider a representative series of ethical issues, proposals, and questions concerning whether the principle of honest anthropomorphism has been violated.",1
"The debate on the ethics of Artificial Intelligence brought together different stakeholders including but not limited to academics, policymakers, CEOs, activists, workers' representatives, lobbyists, journalists, and 'moral machines'. Prominent political institutions crafted principles for the 'ethical being' of the AI companies while tech giants were documenting ethics in a series of self-written guidelines. In parallel, a large community started to flourish, focusing on how to technically embed ethical parameters into algorithmic systems. Founded upon the philosophical work of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, this paper explores the philosophical antinomies of the 'AI Ethics' debate as well as the conceptual disorientation of the 'fairness discussion'. By bringing the philosophy of existentialism to the dialogue, this paper attempts to challenge the dialectical monopoly of utilitarianism and sheds fresh light on the -already glaring- AI arena. Why is 'the AI Ethics guidelines' a futile battle doomed to dangerous abstraction? How this battle can harm our sense of collective freedom? Which is the uncomfortable reality that remains obscured by the smoke-gas of the 'AI Ethics' discussion? And eventually, what's the alternative? There seems to be a different pathway for discussing and implementing ethics; A pathway that sets the freedom of others at the epicenter of the battle for a sustainable and open to all future.",0
"Improving fairness for ranking and regression models has less mature algorithmic tooling than classifiers. Here, we present pairwise formulations of fairness for ranking and regression models that can express analogues of statistical fairness notions like equal opportunity or equal accuracy, as well as statistical parity. The proposed framework supports both discrete protected groups, and continuous protected attributes. We show that the resulting training problems can be efficiently and effectively solved using constrained optimization or robust optimization algorithms. Experiments illustrate the broad applicability and trade-offs of these methods.",1
"Humans are the final decision makers in critical tasks that involve ethical and legal concerns, ranging from recidivism prediction, to medical diagnosis, to fighting against fake news. Although machine learning models can sometimes achieve impressive performance in these tasks, these tasks are not amenable to full automation. To realize the potential of machine learning for improving human decisions, it is important to understand how assistance from machine learning models affects human performance and human agency. In this paper, we use deception detection as a testbed and investigate how we can harness explanations and predictions of machine learning models to improve human performance while retaining human agency. We propose a spectrum between full human agency and full automation, and develop varying levels of machine assistance along the spectrum that gradually increase the influence of machine predictions. We find that without showing predicted labels, explanations alone slightly improve human performance in the end task. In comparison, human performance is greatly improved by showing predicted labels (>20% relative improvement) and can be further improved by explicitly suggesting strong machine performance. Interestingly, when predicted labels are shown, explanations of machine predictions induce a similar level of accuracy as an explicit statement of strong machine performance. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between human performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predictions can moderate this tradeoff.",0
"There has been rapidly growing interest in the use of algorithms in hiring, especially as a means to address or mitigate bias. Yet, to date, little is known about how these methods are used in practice. How are algorithmic assessments built, validated, and examined for bias? In this work, we document and analyze the claims and practices of companies offering algorithms for employment assessment. In particular, we identify vendors of algorithmic pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and evaluate their practices, focusing particularly on efforts to detect and mitigate bias. Our analysis considers both technical and legal perspectives. Technically, we consider the various choices vendors make regarding data collection and prediction targets, and explore the risks and trade-offs that these choices pose. We also discuss how algorithmic de-biasing techniques interface with, and create challenges for, antidiscrimination law.",1
"The EU General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"") is often represented as a larger than life behemoth that will fundamentally transform the world of big data. Abstracted from its constituent parts of corresponding rights, responsibilities, and exemptions, the operative scope of the GDPR can be unduly aggrandized, when in reality, it caters to the specific policy objectives of legislators and institutional stakeholders. With much uncertainty ahead on the precise implementation of the GDPR, academic and policy discussions are debating the adequacy of protections for automated decision-making in GDPR Articles 13 (right to be informed of automated treatment), 15 (right of access by the data subject), and 22 (safeguards to profiling). Unfortunately, the literature to date disproportionately focuses on the impact of AI in the private sector, and deflects any extensive review of automated enforcement tools in public administration. Even though the GDPR enacts significant safeguards against automated decisions, it does so with deliberate design: to balance the interests of data protection with the growing demand for algorithms in the administrative state. In order to facilitate inter-agency data flows and sensitive data processing that fuel the predictive power of algorithmic enforcement tools, the GDPR decisively surrenders to the procedural autonomy of Member States to authorize these practices. Yet, due to a dearth of research on the GDPR's stance on government deployed algorithms, it is not widely known that public authorities can benefit from broadly worded exemptions to restrictions on automated decision-making, and even circumvent remedies for data subjects through national legislation. The potential for public authorities to invoke derogations from the GDPR must be contained by the fundamental guarantees of due process, judicial review, and equal treatment. This paper examines the interplay of these principles within the prospect of algorithmic decision-making by public authorities.",1
"We propose a multi-armed bandit setting where each arm corresponds to a subpopulation, and pulling an arm is equivalent to granting an opportunity to this subpopulation. In this setting the decision-maker's fairness policy governs the number of opportunities each subpopulation should receive, which typically depends on the (unknown) reward from granting an opportunity to this subpopulation. The decision-maker can decide whether to provide these opportunities, or pay a pre-defined monetary value for every withheld opportunity. The decision-maker's objective is to maximize her utility, which is the sum of rewards minus the cost paid for withheld opportunities. We provide a no-regret algorithm that maximizes the decision-maker's utility and complement our analysis with an almost-tight lower bound. Finally, we discuss the fairness policy and demonstrate its downstream implications on the utility and opportunities via simulations.",0
"Many organizations have published principles intended to guide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems; however, their abstract nature makes them difficult to operationalize. Some organizations have therefore produced AI ethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific concepts, such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unless checklists are grounded in practitioners’ needs, they may be misused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, we conducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners, focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklist and identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness checklists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists could provide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hoc processes and empowering individual advocates. We discuss aspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacy of such checklists, and highlight future research directions.",1
"Recent work has revealed that major automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems such as Apple, Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft perform much more poorly for Black U.S. speakers than for white U.S. speakers. Researchers postulate that this may be a result of biased datasets which are largely racially homogeneous. However, while the study of ASR performance with regards to the intersection of racial identity and language use is slowly gaining traction within AI, machine learning, and algorithmic bias research, little to nothing has been done to examine the data drawn from the spoken corpora which are commonly used in the training and evaluation of ASRs in order to understand whether or not they are actually biased, this study seeks to begin addressing this gap in the research by investigating spoken corpora used for ASR training and evaluation for a grammatical linguistic feature of what the field of linguistics terms African American Language (AAL), a systematic, rule-governed, and legitimate linguistic variety spoken by many (but not all) African Americans in the U.S. This grammatical feature, habitual 'be', is an uninflected form of 'be' that encodes the characteristic of habituality, as in ""I be in my office by 7:30am"", paraphrasable as ""I am usually in my office by 7:30"" in Standardized American English. This study utilizes established corpus linguistics methods on the transcribed data of four major spoken corpora -- Switchboard, Fisher, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech -- to understand the frequency, distribution, and usage of habitual 'be' within each corpus as compared to a reference corpus of spoken AAL -- the Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL). The results find that habitual 'be' appears far less frequently, is dispersed in far fewer transcribed texts, and is surrounded by a much less diverse set of word types and parts of speech in the four ASR corpora as compared with CORAAL. This work provides foundational evidence that spoken corpora used in the training and evaluation of widely used ASR systems are, in fact, biased against AAL and likely contribute to poorer ASR performance for Black users.",0
"Machine learning technologies are increasingly developed for use in healthcare. While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to fairness, transparency, and accountability that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain underexamined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature and provide a detailed case study covering the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sepsis Watch, a machine learning-driven tool that assists hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. Sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure or death if not treated in time and is the leading cause of inpatient deaths in US hospitals. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing solely on model interpretability to ensure fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for responsibly designing machine learning systems. Our work underscores the limits of model interpretability as a solution to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability in practice. Instead, our work demonstrates other means and goals to achieve FATML values in design and in practice.",0
"Targeted advertising is meant to improve the efficiency of matching advertisers to their customers. However, targeted advertising can also be abused by malicious advertisers to efficiently reach people susceptible to false stories, stoke grievances, and incite social conflict. Since targeted ads are not seen by non-targeted and non-vulnerable people, malicious ads are likely to go unreported and their effects undetected. This work examines a specific case of malicious advertising, exploring the extent to which political ads1 from the Russian Intelligence Research Agency (IRA) run prior to 2016 U.S. elections exploited Facebook's targeted advertising infrastructure to efficiently target ads on divisive or polarizing topics (e.g., immigration, race-based policing) at vulnerable sub-populations. In particular, we do the following: (a) We conduct U.S. census-representative surveys to characterize how users with different political ideologies report, approve, and perceive truth in the content of the IRA ads. Our surveys show that many ads are ""divisive"": they elicit very different reactions from people belonging to different socially salient groups. (b) We characterize how these divisive ads are targeted to sub-populations that feel particularly aggrieved by the status quo. Our findings support existing calls for greater transparency of content and targeting of political ads. (c) We particularly focus on how the Facebook ad API facilitates such targeting. We show how the enormous amount of personal data Facebook aggregates about users and makes available to advertisers enables such malicious targeting.",0
"As recent literature has demonstrated how classifiers often carry unintended biases toward some subgroups, deploying machine learned models to users demands careful consideration of the social consequences. How should we address this problem in a real-world system? How should we balance core performance and fairness metrics? In this paper, we introduce a MinDiff framework for regularizing classifiers toward different fairness metrics and analyze a technique with kernel-based statistical dependency tests. We run a thorough study on an academic dataset to compare the Pareto frontier achieved by different regularization approaches, and apply our kernel-based method to two large-scale industrial systems demonstrating real-world improvements.",1
"A distinction has been drawn in fair machine learning research between 'group' and 'individual' fairness measures. Many technical research papers assume that both are important, but conflicting, and propose ways to minimise the trade-offs between these measures. This paper argues that this apparent conflict is based on a misconception. It draws on discussions from within the fair machine learning research, and from political and legal philosophy, to argue that individual and group fairness are not fundamentally in conflict. First, it outlines accounts of egalitarian fairness which encompass plausible motivations for both group and individual fairness, thereby suggesting that there need be no conflict in principle. Second, it considers the concept of individual justice, from legal philosophy and jurisprudence, which seems similar but actually contradicts the notion of individual fairness as proposed in the fair machine learning literature. The conclusion is that the apparent conflict between individual and group fairness is more of an artefact of the blunt application of fairness measures, rather than a matter of conflicting principles. In practice, this conflict may be resolved by a nuanced consideration of the sources of 'unfairness' in a particular deployment context, and the carefully justified application of measures to mitigate it.",0
"Problematic web search query completion suggestions—perceived as biased, offensive, or in some other way harmful—can reinforce existing stereotypes and misbeliefs, and even nudge users towards undesirable patterns of behavior.  Locating such suggestions is difficult, not only due to the long-tailed nature of web search, but also due to differences in how people assess potential harms.  Grounding our study in web search query logs, we explore when system-provided suggestions might be perceived as problematic through a series of crowd-experiments where we systematically manipulate: the search query fragments provided by users,  possible user search intents, and the list of query completion suggestions.  To examine why query suggestions might be perceived as problematic, we contrast them to an inventory of known types of problematic suggestions. We report our observations around differences in the prevalence of  a) suggestions that are problematic on their own versus  b) suggestions that are problematic for the query fragment provided by a user, for both common informational needs and in the presence of web search voids—topics searched by few to no users.  Our experiments surface a rich array of scenarios where suggestions are considered problematic, including due to the context in which they were surfaced. Compounded by the elusive nature of many such scenarios, the prevalence of suggestions perceived as problematic only for certain user inputs, raises concerns about blind spots due to data annotation practices that may lead to some types of problematic suggestions being overlooked.",1
"Automated decision making has become widespread in recent years, largely due to advances in machine learning. As a result of this trend, machine learning systems are increasingly used to make decisions in high-stakes domains, such as employment or university admissions. The weightiness of these decisions has prompted the realization that, like humans, machines must also comply with the law. But human decision-making processes are quite different from automated decision-making processes, which creates a mismatch between laws and the decision makers to which they are intended to apply. In turn, this mismatch can lead to counterproductive outcomes.",1
"We present a large-scale study of gender bias in occupation classification, a task where the use of machine learning may lead to negative outcomes on peoples' lives. We analyze the potential allocation harms that can result from semantic representation bias. To do so, we study the impact on occupation classification of including explicit gender indicators---such as first names and pronouns---in different semantic representations of online biographies. Additionally, we quantify the bias that remains when these indicators are ""scrubbed,"" and describe proxy behavior that occurs in the absence of explicit gender indicators. As we demonstrate, differences in true positive rates between genders are correlated with existing gender imbalances in occupations, which may compound these imbalances.",1
"We present FlipTest, a black-box technique for uncovering discrimination in classifiers. FlipTest is motivated by the intuitive question: had an individual been of a different protected status, would the model have treated them differently? Rather than relying on causal information to answer this question, FlipTest leverages optimal transport to match individuals in different protected groups, creating similar pairs of in-distribution samples. We show how to use these instances to detect discrimination by constructing a flipset: the set of individuals whose classifier output changes post-translation, which corresponds to the set of people who may be harmed because of their group membership. To shed light on why the model treats a given subgroup differently, FlipTest produces a transparency report: a ranking of features that are most associated with the model's behavior on the flipset. Evaluating the approach on three case studies, we show that this provides a computationally inexpensive way to identify subgroups that may be harmed by model discrimination, including in cases where the model satisfies group fairness criteria.",0
"This paper proposes new search algorithms for counterfactual explanations based upon mixed integer programming. We are concerned with complex data in which variables may take any value from a contiguous range or an additional set of discrete states. We propose a novel set of constraints that we refer to as a ""mixed polytope"" and show how this can be used with an integer programming solver to efficiently find coherent counterfactual explanations i.e. solutions that are guaranteed to map back onto the underlying data structure, while avoiding the need for brute-force enumeration. We also look at the problem of diverse explanations and show how these can be generated within our framework.",0
"We study a two-stage model, in which students are 1) admitted to college on the basis of an entrance exam which is a noisy signal about their qualifications (type), and then 2) those students who were admitted to college can be hired by an employer as a function of their college grades, which are an independently drawn noisy signal of their type. Students are drawn from one of two populations, which might have different type distributions. We assume that the employer at the end of the pipeline is rational, in the sense that it computes a posterior distribution on student type conditional on all information that it has available (college admissions, grades, and group membership), and makes a decision based on posterior expectation. We then study what kinds of fairness goals can be achieved by the college by setting its admissions rule and grading policy. For example, the college might have the goal of guaranteeing equal opportunity across populations: that the probability of passing through the pipeline and being hired by the employer should be independent of group membership, conditioned on type. Alternately, the college might have the goal of incentivizing the employer to have a group blind hiring rule. We show that both goals can be achieved when the college does not report grades. On the other hand, we show that under reasonable conditions, these goals are impossible to achieve even in isolation when the college uses an (even minimally) informative grading policy.",0
"Anonymized smartphone-based mobility data has been widely adopted in devising and evaluating COVID-19 response strategies such as the targeting of public health resources. Yet little attention has been paid to measurement validity and demographic bias, due in part to the lack of documentation about which users are represented as well as the challenge of obtaining ground truth data on unique visits and demographics. We illustrate how linking large-scale administrative data can enable auditing mobility data for bias in the absence of demographic information and ground truth labels. More precisely, we show that linking voter roll data---containing individual-level voter turnout for specific voting locations along with race and age---can facilitate the construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests. Using data from North Carolina's 2018 general election, these tests illuminate a sampling bias that is particularly noteworthy in the pandemic context: older and non-white voters are less likely to be captured by mobility data. We show that allocating public health resources based on such mobility data could disproportionately harm high-risk elderly and minority groups.",0
"Recent debate within the FAT* community has focused on how the field conceptualizes the problems it seeks to address, what approach the field should take in attempting to address these problems, and whether the field should even pursue some of the proposed remedies. Questions regarding when not to design, build, or deploy a technology are perhaps the most common expression of this trend. Identifying the problems to address is inextricably linked to the broader question of how to collectively make decisions about what technologies our societies need and want.",1
"The debate about fairness in machine learning has largely centered around competing substantive definitions of what fairness or nondiscrimination between groups requires. However, very little attention has been paid to what precisely a group is. Many recent approaches have abandoned observational, or purely statistical, definitions of fairness in favor of definitions that require one to specify a causal model of the data generating process. The implicit ontological assumption of these exercises is that a racial or sex group is a collection of individuals who share a trait or attribute, for example: the group ""female"" simply consists in grouping individuals who share female-coded sex features. We show this by exploring the formal assumption of modularity in causal models using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which hold that the dependencies captured by one causal pathway are invariant to interventions on any other causal pathways. Modeling sex, for example, as a node in a causal model aimed at elucidating fairness questions proposes two substantive claims: 1) There exists a feature, sex-on-its-own, that is an inherent trait of an individual that then (causally) brings about social phenomena external to it in the world; and 2) the relations between sex and its downstream effects can be modified in whichever ways and the former node would still retain the meaning that sex has in our world. Together, these claims suggest sex to be a category that could be different in its (causal) relations with other features of our social world via hypothetical interventions yet still mean what it means in our world. This fundamental stability of categories and causes (unless explicitly intervened on) is essential in the methodology of causal inference, because without it, causal operations can alter the meaning of a category, fundamentally change how it is situated within a causal diagram, and undermine the validity of any inferences drawn on the diagram as corresponding to any real phenomena in the world. We argue that these methods' ontological assumptions about social groups such as sex are conceptual errors. Many of the ""effects"" that sex purportedly ""causes"" are in fact constitutive features of sex as a social status. They constitute what it means to be sexed. In other words, together, they give the social meaning of sex features. These social meanings are precisely, we argue, what makes sex discrimination a distinctively morally problematic type of act that differs from mere irrationality or meanness on the basis of a physical feature. Correcting this conceptual error has a number of important implications for how analytical models can be used to detect discrimination. If what makes something discrimination on the basis of a particular social grouping is that the practice acts on what it means to be in that group in a way that we deem wrongful, then what we need from analytical diagrams is a model of what constitutes the social grouping. Such a model would allow us to explain the special moral (and legal) reasons we have to be concerned with the treatment of this category by reference to the empirical social relations and meanings that establish the category as what it is. Only then can we have the normative debate about what is fair or nondiscriminatory vis-à-vis that group. We suggest that formal diagrams of constitutive relations would present an entirely different path toward reasoning about discrimination (and relatedly, counterfactuals) because they proffer a model of how the meaning of a social group emerges from its constitutive features. Whereas the value of causal diagrams is to guide the construction and testing of sophisticated modular counterfactuals, the value of constitutive diagrams would be to identify a different kind of counterfactual as central to our inquiry into discrimination: one that asks how the social meaning of a group would be changed if its non-modular features were altered.",0
"A key goal of the fair-ML community is to develop machine-learning based systems that, once introduced into a social context, can achieve social and legal outcomes such as fairness, justice, and due process. Bedrock concepts in computer science---such as abstraction and modular design---are used to define notions of fairness and discrimination, to produce fairness-aware learning algorithms, and to intervene at different stages of a decision-making pipeline to produce ""fair"" outcomes. In this paper, however, we contend that these concepts render technical interventions ineffective, inaccurate, and sometimes dangerously misguided when they enter the societal context that surrounds decision-making systems. We outline this mismatch with five ""traps"" that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.",1
"Organizations cannot address demographic disparities that they cannot see. Recent research on machine learning and fairness has emphasized that awareness of sensitive attributes, such as race and sex, is critical to the development of interventions. However, on the ground, the existence of these data cannot be taken for granted. This paper uses the domains of employment, credit, and healthcare in the United States to surface conditions that have shaped the availability of sensitive attribute data. For each domain, we describe how and when private companies collect or infer sensitive attribute data for antidiscrimination purposes. An inconsistent story emerges: Some companies are required by law to collect sensitive attribute data, while others are prohibited from doing so. Still others, in the absence of legal mandates, have determined that collection and imputation of these data are appropriate to address disparities. This story has important implications for fairness research and its future applications. If companies that mediate access to life opportunities are unable or hesitant to collect or infer sensitive attribute data, then proposed techniques to detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models might never be implemented outside the lab. We conclude that today's legal requirements and corporate practices, while highly inconsistent across domains, offer lessons for how to approach the collection and inference of sensitive data in appropriate circumstances. We urge stakeholders, including machine learning practitioners, to actively help chart a path forward that takes both policy goals and technical needs into account.",0
"We introduce a simple framework for identifying biases of a smiling attribute classifier. Our method poses counterfactual questions of the form: how would the prediction change if this face characteristic had been different? We leverage recent advances in generative adversarial networks to build a realistic generative model of faces that affords controlled manipulation of specific facial characteristics. Empirically, we identify several different factors of variation (that we believe should be in-dependent of a smiling) that  affect the predictions of a smiling classifier trained on CelebA.",1
"Diversity, including gender diversity, is valued by many software development organizations, yet the field remains dominated by men. One reason for this lack of diversity is gender bias. In this paper, we study the effects of that bias by using an existing framework derived from the gender studies literature. We adapt the four main effects proposed in the framework by posing hypotheses about how they might manifest on GitHub, then evaluate those hypotheses quantitatively. While our results show that effects of gender bias are largely invisible on the GitHub platform itself, there are still signals of women concentrating their work in fewer places and being more restrained in communication than men.",1
"Employers are increasingly using information and communication technologies to monitor employees. Such workplace surveillance is extensive in the United States, but its experience and potential consequences differ across groups based on gender. We thus sought to identify whether self‐reported male and female employees differ in the extent to which they find the use of workplace cameras equipped with facial recognition technology (FRT) acceptable, and examine the role of privacy attitudes more generally in mediating views on workplace surveillance. Using data from a nationally representative survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, we find that women are much less likely than men to approve of the use of cameras using FRT in the workplace. We then further explore whether men and women think differently about privacy, and if perceptions of privacy moderate the relationship between gender and approval of workplace surveillance. Finally, we consider the implications of these findings for privacy and surveillance via embedded technologies, and how the consequences of surveillance and technologies like FRT may be gendered. Note: We recognize evaluations based on a binary definition of gender are invariably partial and exclusionary. As we note in our discussion of the study’s limitations, we were constrained by the survey categories provided by Pew.",1
"A/B/n testing has been adopted by many technology companies as a data-driven approach to product design and optimization. These tests are often run on their websites without explicit consent from users. In this paper, we investigate such online A/B/n tests by using Optimizely as a lens. First, we provide measurement results of 575 websites that use Optimizely drawn from the Alexa Top-1M, and analyze the distributions of their audiences and experiments. Then, we use three case studies to discuss potential ethical pitfalls of such experiments, including involvement of political content, price discrimination, and advertising campaigns. We conclude with a suggestion for greater awareness of ethical concerns inherent in human experimentation and a call for increased transparency among A/B/n test operators.",0
"While professionals are increasingly relying on algorithmic systems for making a decision, on some occasions, algorithmic decisions may be perceived as biased or not just. Prior work has looked into the perception of algorithmic decision-making from the user's point of view. In this work, we investigate how students in fields adjacent to algorithm development perceive algorithmic decisionmaking. Participants (N=99) were asked to rate their agreement with statements regarding six constructs that are related to facets of fairness and justice in algorithmic decision-making in three separate scenarios. Two of the three scenarios were independent of each other, while the third scenario presented three different outcomes of the same algorithmic system, demonstrating perception changes triggered by different outputs. Quantitative analysis indicates that a) 'agreeing' with a decision does not mean the person 'deserves the outcome', b) perceiving the factors used in the decision-making as 'appropriate' does not make the decision of the system 'fair' and c) perceiving a system's decision as 'not fair' is affecting the participants' 'trust' in the system. In addition, participants found proportional distribution of benefits more fair than other approaches. Qualitative analysis provides further insights into that information the participants find essential to judge and understand an algorithmic decision-making system's fairness. Finally, the level of academic education has a role to play in the perception of fairness and justice in algorithmic decision-making.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral skills, but real-world application of these methods requires a considerable amount of experience to be collected by the agent. In practical settings, such as robotics, this involves repeatedly attempting a task, resetting the environment between each attempt. However, not all tasks are easily or automatically reversible. In practice, this learning process requires considerable human intervention. In this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and backward policy, with the backward policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the backward policy, we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts. Our experiments illustrate that proper use of the backward policy can greatly reduce the number of manual resets required to learn a task and can reduce the number of unsafe actions that lead to non-reversible states.",1
"The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains. To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information. By analogy, we propose that every dataset be accompanied with a datasheet that documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on. Datasheets for datasets will facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers, and encourage the machine learning community to prioritize transparency and accountability.",1
"Algorithmic fairness aims to address the economic, moral, social, and political impact that digital systems have on populations through solutions that can be applied by service providers. Fairness frameworks do so, in part, by mapping these problems to a narrow definition and assuming the service providers can be trusted to deploy countermeasures. Not surprisingly, these decisions limit fairness frameworks' ability to capture a variety of harms caused by systems. We characterize fairness limitations using concepts from requirements engineering and from social sciences. We show that the focus on algorithms' inputs and outputs misses harms that arise from systems interacting with the world; that the focus on bias and discrimination omits broader harms on populations and their environments; and that relying on service providers excludes scenarios where they are not cooperative or intentionally adversarial. We propose Protective Optimization Technologies (POTs). POTs, provide means for affected parties to address the negative impacts of systems in the environment, expanding avenues for political contestation. POTs intervene from outside the system, do not require service providers to cooperate, and can serve to correct, shift, or expose harms that systems impose on populations and their environments. We illustrate the potential and limitations of POTs in two case studies: countering road congestion caused by traffic beating applications, and recalibrating credit scoring for loan applicants.",0
"Two food banks catering to populations of different sizes with different needs must divide among themselves a donation of food items. What constitutes a ""fair"" allocation of the items among them? Competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI) is a classic solution to the problem of fair and efficient allocation of goods among equally entitled agents [Foley 1967, Varian 1974]. Every agent (foodbank) receives an equal endowment of artificial currency with which to ""purchase"" bundles of goods (food items). Prices for the goods are set high enough such that the agents can simultaneously get their favorite within-budget bundle, and low enough such that all goods are allocated (no waste). A CEEI satisfies mathematical notions of fairness like fair-share, and also has built-in transparency -- prices can be published so the agents can verify they're being treated equally. However, a CEEI is not guaranteed to exist when the items are indivisible. We study competitive equilibrium from generic incomes (CEGI), which is based on the idea of slightly perturbed endowments, and enjoys similar fairness, efficiency and transparency properties as CEEI. We show that when the two agents have almost equal endowments and additive preferences for the items, a CEGI always exists. We then consider agents who are a priori non-equal (like different-sized foodbanks); we formulate a new notion of fair allocation among non-equals satisfied by CEGI, and show existence in cases of interest (like when the agents have identical preferences). Experiments on simulated and Spliddit data (a popular fair division website) indicate more general existence. Our results open opportunities for future research on fairness through generic endowments, and on fair treatment of non-equals.",1
"In this paper, we present TILT, a transparency information language and toolkit explicitly designed to represent and process transparency information in line with the requirements of the GDPR and allowing for a more automated and adaptive use of such information than established, legalese data protection policies do. We provide a detailed analysis of transparency obligations from the GDPR to identify the expressiveness required for a formal transparency language intended to meet respective legal requirements. In addition, we identify a set of further, non-functional requirements that need to be met to foster practical adoption in real-world (web) information systems engineering. On this basis, we specify our formal language and present a respective, fully implemented toolkit around it. We then evaluate the practical applicability of our language and toolkit and demonstrate the additional prospects it unlocks through two different use cases: a) the inter-organizational analysis of personal data-related practices allowing, for instance, to uncover data sharing networks based on explicitly announced transparency information and b) the presentation of formally represented transparency information to users through novel, more comprehensible, and potentially adaptive user interfaces, heightening data subjects' actual informedness about data-related practices and, thus, their sovereignty. Altogether, our transparency information language and toolkit allow - differently from previous work - to express transparency information in line with actual legal requirements and practices of modern (web) information systems engineering and thereby pave the way for a multitude of novel possibilities to heighten transparency and user sovereignty in practice.",0
"A recent normative turn in computer science has brought concerns about fairness, bias, and accountability to the core of the field. Yet recent scholarship has warned that much of this technical work treats problematic features of the status quo as fixed, and fails to address deeper patterns of injustice and inequality. While acknowledging these critiques, we posit that computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems --- roles whose value can be recognized even from a perspective that aspires toward fundamental social change. In this paper, we articulate four such roles, through an analysis that considers the opportunities as well as the significant risks inherent in such work. Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming computing's capacity to solve social problems on its own.",1
"Online learning algorithms, widely used to power search and content optimization on the web, must balance exploration and exploitation, potentially sacrificing the experience of current users for information that will lead to better decisions in the future. Recently, concerns have been raised about whether the process of exploration could be viewed as unfair, placing too much burden on certain individuals or groups. Motivated by these concerns, we initiate the study of the externalities of exploration – the undesirable side effects that the presence of one party may impose on another – under the linear contextual bandits model. We introduce the notion of a group externality, measuring the extent to which the presence of one population of users impacts the rewards of another. We show that this impact can in some cases be negative, and that, in a certain sense, no algorithm can avoid it. We then study externalities at the individual level, interpreting the act of exploration as an externality imposed on the current user of a system by future users. This drives us to ask under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes explicit exploration unnecessary. We build on a recent line of work on the smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm that always chooses the action that currently looks optimal, improving on prior results to show that a greedy approach almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold, and that this regret is at most O~(T1/3)",1
"In various business settings, there is an interest in using more complex machine learning techniques for sales forecasting. It is difficult to convince analysts, along with their superiors, to adopt these techniques since the models are considered to be ""black boxes,"" even if they perform better than current models in use. We examine the impact of contrastive explanations about large errors on users' attitudes towards a ""black-box"" model. We propose an algorithm, Monte Carlo Bounds for Reasonable Predictions. Given a large error, MC-BRP determines (1) feature values that would result in a reasonable prediction, and (2) general trends between each feature and the target, both based on Monte Carlo simulations. We evaluate on a real dataset with real users by conducting a user study with 75 participants to determine if explanations generated by MC-BRP help users understand why a prediction results in a large error, and if this promotes trust in an automatically-learned model. Our study shows that users are able to answer objective questions about the model's predictions with overall 81.1% accuracy when provided with these contrastive explanations. We show that users who saw MC-BRP explanations understand why the model makes large errors in predictions significantly more than users in the control group. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of the difference in attitudes between Practitioners and Researchers, and confirm that our results hold when conditioning on the users' background.",1
"In this paper we highlight the risks of relying on mean-field variational inference to learn models that are used as simulators for decision making. We study the role of accurate inference for latent variable models in terms of cumulative reward performance. We show how naive mean-field variational inference at test time can lead to poor decisions in basic but fundamental quadratic control problems with continuous actions, as relevant correlations in the latent space are ignored. We then extend these examples to a more complex non-linear scenario with asymmetric costs, where regret is even more significant.",1
"We introduce leave-one-out unfairness, which characterizes how likely a model's prediction for an individual will change due to the inclusion or removal of a single other person in the model's training data. Leave-one-out unfairness appeals to the idea that fair decisions are not arbitrary: they should not be based on the chance event of any one person's inclusion in the training data. Leave-one-out unfairness is closely related to algorithmic stability, but it focuses on the consistency of an individual point's prediction outcome over unit changes to the training data, rather than the error of the model in aggregate. Beyond formalizing leave-one-out unfairness, we characterize the extent to which deep models behave leave-one-out unfairly on real data, including in cases where the generalization error is small. Further, we demonstrate that adversarial training and randomized smoothing techniques have opposite effects on leave-one-out fairness, which sheds light on the relationships between robustness, memorization, individual fairness, and leave-one-out fairness in deep models. Finally, we discuss salient practical applications that may be negatively affected by leave-one-out unfairness.",0
"The Rooney Rule, originally proposed to counter implicit bias in hiring, has been implemented in the private and public sector in various settings. This rule requires that a decision-maker include at least one candidate from an underrepresented group in their shortlist of candidates. Recently, [42] proposed a mathematical model of implicit bias and studied the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule when applied to a single selection decision. However, selection decisions often occur repeatedly over time; e.g., a software firm is continuously hiring employees or a university makes admissions decisions every year. Further, it has been observed that, given consistent counterstereotypical feedback, implicit biases against underrepresented candidates can change. In this paper, we propose a model of how a decision-maker's implicit bias changes over time given their hiring decisions either with or without the Rooney Rule in place. Our model draws from the work of [42] and the literature on opinion dynamics. Our main result is that, for this model, when the decision-maker is constrained by the Rooney Rule, their implicit bias roughly reduces at a rate that is inverse of the size of the shortlist---independent of the total number of candidates, whereas without the Rooney Rule, the rate is inversely proportional to the number of candidates. Thus, our model predicts that when the number of candidates is much larger than the size of the shortlist, the Rooney Rule enables a significantly faster reduction in implicit bias, providing additional reason in favor of instating it as a strategy to mitigate implicit bias. Towards empirically evaluating the long-term effect of the Rooney Rule in repeated selection decisions, we conduct an iterative candidate selection experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We observe that, indeed, decision-makers subject to the Rooney Rule select more minority candidates in addition to those required by the rule itself than they would if no rule is in effect, and in fact are able to do so without considerably decreasing the utility of candidates selected.",0
"Can we efficiently extract useful information from a large user-generated dataset while protecting the privacy of the users and/or ensuring fairness in representation. We cast this problem as an instance of a deletion-robust submodular maximization where part of the data may be deleted due to privacy concerns or fairness criteria. We propose the first memory-efficient centralized, streaming, and distributed methods with constant-factor approximation guarantees against \textit&lbrace;any&rbrace; number of adversarial deletions. We extensively evaluate the performance of our algorithms against prior state-of-the-art on real-world applications, including (i) Uber-pick up locations with location privacy constraints; (ii) feature selection with fairness constraints for income prediction and crime rate prediction; and (iii) robust to deletion summarization of census data, consisting of 2,458,285 feature vectors.",1
"Deep learning has shown that learned functions can dramatically outperform hand-designed functions on perceptual tasks. Analogously, this suggests that learned optimizers may similarly outperform current hand-designed optimizers, especially for specific problems. However, learned optimizers are notoriously difficult to train and have yet to demonstrate wall-clock speedups over hand-designed optimizers, and thus are rarely used in practice. Typically, learned optimizers are trained by truncated backpropagation through an unrolled optimization process. The resulting gradients are either strongly biased (for short truncations) or have exploding norm (for long truncations). In this work we propose a training scheme which overcomes both of these difficulties, by dynamically weighting two unbiased gradient estimators for a variational loss on optimizer performance. This allows us to train neural networks to perform optimization of a specific task faster than tuned first-order methods. Moreover, by training the optimizer against validation loss (as opposed to training loss), we are able to learn optimizers that train networks to generalize better than first order methods. We demonstrate these results on problems where our learned optimizer trains convolutional networks faster in wall-clock time compared to tuned first-order methods and with an improvement in test loss.",1
"Fairness in advertising is a topic of particular concern motivated by theoretical and empirical observations in both the computer science and economics literature. We examine the problem of fairness in advertising for general purpose platforms that service advertisers from many different categories. First, we propose inter-category and intra-category fairness desiderata that take inspiration from individual fairness and envy-freeness. Second, we investigate the ""platform utility"" (a proxy for the quality of allocation) achievable by mechanisms satisfying these desiderata. More specifically, we compare the utility of fair mechanisms against the unfair optimum, and show by construction that our fairness desiderata are compatible with utility. Our mechanisms also enjoy nice implementation properties including metric-obliviousness, which allows the platform to produce fair allocations without needing to know the specifics of the fairness requirements.",0
"There have been multiple calls for integrating topics related to fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics (FATE) and social justice into Data Science curricula, but little exploration of how this might work in practice. This paper presents the findings of a collaborative auto-ethnography (CAE) engaged in by a MSc Data Science teaching team based at University of Sheffield (UK) Information School where FATE/Critical Data Studies (CDS) topics have been a core part of the curriculum since 2015/16. In this paper, we adopt the CAE approach to reflect on our experiences of working at the intersection of disciplines, and our progress and future plans for integrating FATE/CDS into the curriculum. We identify a series of challenges for deeper FATE/CDS integration related to our own competencies and the wider socio-material context of Higher Education in the UK. We conclude with recommendations for ourselves and the wider FATE/CDS orientated Data Science community.",0
"Government agencies are embracing machine learning to support a variety of resource allocation decisions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, has engaged academic research labs to test the use of machine learning in support of an important national initiative to reduce Clean Water Act violations. We evaluate prototypical risk prediction models that can support compliance interventions and demonstrate how critical algorithmic design choices can generate or mitigate disparate impact in environmental enforcement. First, we show that the definition of which facilities to focus on through this national compliance initiative hinges on arbitrary differences in state-level permitting schemes, causing a shift in environmental protection away from areas with more minority populations. Second, the policy objective to reduce the noncompliance rate is encoded in a classification model, which does not account for the extent of pollution beyond the permitted limit. We hence compare allocation schemes between regression and classification, and show that the latter directs attention towards facilities in more rural and white areas. Overall, our study illustrates that as machine learning enters government, algorithmic design can both embed and elucidate sources of administrative policy discretion with discernable distributional consequences.",0
"Data collected about individuals is regularly used to make decisions that impact those same individuals. We consider settings where sensitive personal data is used to decide who will receive resources or benefits. While it is well known that there is a trade-off between protecting privacy and the accuracy of decisions, we initiate a first-of-its-kind study into the impact of formally private mechanisms (based on differential privacy) on fair and equitable decision-making. We empirically investigate novel tradeoffs on two real-world decisions made using U.S. Census data (allocation of federal funds and assignment of voting rights benefits) as well as a classic apportionment problem. Our results show that if decisions are made using an ∈-differentially private version of the data, under strict privacy constraints (smaller ∈), the noise added to achieve privacy may disproportionately impact some groups over others. We propose novel measures of fairness in the context of randomized differentially private algorithms and identify a range of causes of outcome disparities. We also explore improved algorithms to remedy the unfairness observed.",0
"We study the problem of learning classifiers robust to universal adversarial perturbations. While prior work approaches this problem via robust optimization, adversarial training, or input transformation, we instead phrase it as a two-player zero-sum game. In this new formulation, both players simultaneously play the same game, where one player chooses a classifier that minimizes a classification loss whilst the other player creates an adversarial perturbation that increases the same loss when applied to every sample in the training set. By observing that performing a classification (respectively creating adversarial samples) is the best response to the other player, we propose a novel extension of a game-theoretic algorithm, namely \fp,  to the domain of training robust classifiers. Finally, we empirically show the robustness and versatility of our approach in two defence scenarios where universal attacks are performed on several image classification datasets -- CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet.",1
"Recent work has documented instances of unfairness in deployed machine learning models, and significant researcher effort has been dedicated to creating algorithms that intrinsically consider fairness. In this work, we highlight another source of unfairness: market forces that drive differential investment in the data pipeline for differing groups. We develop a high-level model to study this question. First, we show that our model predicts unfairness in a monopoly setting. Then, we show that under all but the most extreme models, competition does not eliminate this tendency, and may even exacerbate it. Finally, we consider two avenues for regulating a machine-learning driven monopolist - relative error inequality and absolute error-bounds - and quantify the price of fairness (and who pays it). These models imply that mitigating fairness concerns may require policy-driven solutions, not only technological ones.",1
"Thanks to the increasing growth of computational power and data availability, the research in machine learning has advanced with tremendous rapidity. Nowadays, the majority of automatic decision making systems are based on data. However, it is well known that machine learning systems can present problematic results if they are built on partial or incomplete data. In fact, in recent years several studies have found a convergence of issues related to the ethics and transparency of these systems in the process of data collection and how they are recorded. Although the process of rigorous data collection and analysis is fundamental in the model design, this step is still largely overlooked by the machine learning community. For this reason, we propose a method of data annotation based on Bayesian statistical inference that aims to warn about the risk of discriminatory results of a given data set. In particular, our method aims to deepen knowledge and promote awareness about the sampling practices employed to create the training set, highlighting that the probability of success or failure conditioned to a minority membership is given by the structure of the data available. We empirically test our system on three datasets commonly accessed by the machine learning community and we investigate the risk of racial discrimination.",0
"The societal and ethical implications of the use of opaque artificial intelligence systems in consequential decisions, such as welfare allocation and criminal justice, have generated a lively debate among multiple stakeholders, including computer scientists, ethicists, social scientists, policy makers, and end users. However, the lack of a common language or a multi-dimensional framework to appropriately bridge the technical, epistemic, and normative aspects of this debate nearly prevents the discussion from being as productive as it could be. Drawing on the philosophical literature on the nature and value of explanations, this paper offers a multi-faceted framework that brings more conceptual precision to the present debate by identifying the types of explanations that are most pertinent to artificial intelligence predictions, recognizing the relevance and importance of the social and ethical values for the evaluation of these explanations, and demonstrating the importance of these explanations for incorporating a diversified approach to improving the design of truthful algorithmic ecosystems. The proposed philosophical framework thus lays the groundwork for establishing a pertinent connection between the technical and ethical aspects of artificial intelligence systems.",0
"When consequential decisions are informed by algorithmic input, individuals may feel compelled to alter their behavior in order to gain a system's approval. Models of agent responsiveness, termed ""strategic manipulation,"" analyze the interaction between a learner and agents in a world where all agents are equally able to manipulate their features in an attempt to ""trick"" a published classifier. In cases of real world classification, however, an agent's ability to adapt to an algorithm is not simply a function of her personal interest in receiving a positive classification, but is bound up in a complex web of social factors that affect her ability to pursue certain action responses. In this paper, we adapt models of strategic manipulation to capture dynamics that may arise in a setting of social inequality wherein candidate groups face different costs to manipulation. We find that whenever one group's costs are higher than the other's, the learner's equilibrium strategy exhibits an inequality-reinforcing phenomenon wherein the learner erroneously admits some members of the advantaged group, while erroneously excluding some members of the disadvantaged group. We also consider the effects of interventions in which a learner subsidizes members of the disadvantaged group, lowering their costs in order to improve her own classification performance. Here we encounter a paradoxical result: there exist cases in which providing a subsidy improves only the learner's utility while actually making both candidate groups worse-off---even the group receiving the subsidy. Our results reveal the potentially adverse social ramifications of deploying tools that attempt to evaluate an individual's ""quality"" when agents' capacities to adaptively respond differ.",1
"In 2015, Delhi Police announced plans for predictive policing. The Crime Mapping, Analytics and Predictive System (CMAPS) would be implemented in India's capital, for live spatial hotspot mapping of crime, criminal behavior patterns and suspect analysis. Four years later, there is little known about the effect of CMAPS due to the lack of public accountability mechanisms and large exceptions for law enforcement under India's Right to Information Act. Through an ethnographic study of Delhi Police's data collection practices, and analysing the institutional and legal reality within which CMAPS will function, this paper presents one of the first accounts of smart policing in India. Through our findings and discussion we show what kinds of biases are present within Delhi Police's data collection practices currently and how they translate and transfer into initiatives like CMAPS. We further discuss what the biases in CMAPS can teach us about future public sector deployment of socio-technical systems in India and other global South geographies. We also offer methodological considerations for studying AI deployments in non-western contexts. We conclude with a set of recommendations for civil society and social justice actors to consider when engaging with opaque systems implemented in the public sector.",0
"Settings such as lending and policing can be modeled by a centralized agent allocating a scarce resource (e.g. loans or police officers) amongst several groups, in order to maximize some objective (e.g. loans given that are repaid, or criminals that are apprehended). Often in such problems fairness is also a concern. One natural notion of fairness, based on general principles of equality of opportunity, asks that conditional on an individual being a candidate for the resource in question, the probability of actually receiving it is approximately independent of the individual's group. For example, in lending this would mean that equally creditworthy individuals in different racial groups have roughly equal chances of receiving a loan. In policing it would mean that two individuals committing the same crime in different districts would have roughly equal chances of being arrested. In this paper, we formalize this general notion of fairness for allocation problems and investigate its algorithmic consequences. Our main technical results include an efficient learning algorithm that converges to an optimal fair allocation even when the allocator does not know the frequency of candidates (i.e. creditworthy individuals or criminals) in each group. This algorithm operates in a censored feedback model in which only the number of candidates who received the resource in a given allocation can be observed, rather than the true number of candidates in each group. This models the fact that we do not learn the creditworthiness of individuals we do not give loans to and do not learn about crimes committed if the police presence in a district is low. As an application of our framework and algorithm, we consider the predictive policing problem, in which the resource being allocated to each group is the number of police officers assigned to each district. The learning algorithm is trained on arrest data gathered from its own deployments on previous days, resulting in a potential feedback loop that our algorithm provably overcomes. In this case, the fairness constraint asks that the probability that an individual who has committed a crime is arrested should be independent of the district in which they live. We investigate the performance of our learning algorithm on the Philadelphia Crime Incidents dataset.",0
"Set functions predict a label from a permutation-invariant variable-size collection of feature vectors. We propose making set functions more understandable and regularized by capturing domain knowledge through shape constraints. We show how prior work in monotonic constraints can be adapted to set functions. Then we propose two new shape constraints designed to generalize the conditioning role of weights in a weighted mean. We show how one can train standard functions and set functions that satisfy these shape constraints with a deep lattice network. We propose a non-linear estimation strategy we call the semantic feature engine that uses set functions with the proposed shape constraints to estimate labels for compound sparse categorical features. Experiments on real-world data show the achieved accuracy is similar to deep sets or deep neural networks, but provides guarantees of the model behavior and is thus easier to explain and debug.",1
"Consequential decision-making typically incentivizes individuals to behave strategically, tailoring their behavior to the specifics of the decision rule. A long line of work has therefore sought to counteract strategic behavior by designing more conservative decision boundaries in an effort to increase robustness to the effects of strategic covariate shift. We show that these efforts benefit the institutional decision maker at the expense of the individuals being classified. Introducing a notion of social burden, we prove that any increase in institutional utility necessarily leads to a corresponding increase in social burden. Moreover, we show that the negative externalities of strategic classification can disproportionately harm disadvantaged groups in the population. Our results highlight that strategy-robustness must be weighed against considerations of social welfare and fairness.",0
"Decision-making systems increasingly orchestrate our world: how to intervene on the algorithmic components to build fair and equitable systems is therefore a question of utmost importance; one that is substantially complicated by the context-dependent nature of fairness and discrimination. Modern decision-making systems that involve allocating resources or information to people (e.g., school choice, advertising) incorporate machine-learned predictions in their pipelines, raising concerns about potential strategic behavior or constrained allocation, concerns usually tackled in the context of mechanism design. Although both machine learning and mechanism design have developed frameworks for addressing issues of fairness and equity, in some complex decision-making systems, neither framework is individually sufficient. In this paper, we develop the position that building fair decision-making systems requires overcoming these limitations which, we argue, are inherent to each field. Our ultimate objective is to build an encompassing framework that cohesively bridges the individual frameworks of mechanism design and machine learning. We begin to lay the ground work towards this goal by comparing the perspective each discipline takes on fair decision-making, teasing out the lessons each field has taught and can teach the other, and highlighting application domains that require a strong collaboration between these disciplines.",0
"We demonstrate how easy it is for modern machine-learned systems to violate common deontological ethical principles and social norms such as ""favor the less fortunate,"" and ""do not penalize good attributes."" We propose that in some cases such ethical principles can be incorporated into a machine-learned model by adding shape constraints that constrain the model to respond only positively to relevant inputs. We analyze the relationship between these deontological constraints that act on individuals and the consequentialist group-based fairness goals of one-sided statistical parity and equal opportunity. This strategy works with sensitive attributes that are Boolean or real-valued such as income and age, and can help produce more responsible and trustworthy AI.",1
"Sensitive statistics are often collected across sets of users, with repeated collection of reports done over time. For example, trends in users' private preferences or software usage may be monitored via such reports. We study the collection of such statistics in the local differential privacy (LDP) model, and describe an algorithm whose privacy cost is polylogarithmic in the number of changes to a user's value.  ",1
"In this work we address the practical challenges of training machine learning models on privacy-sensitive datasets by introducing a modular approach that minimizes changes to training algorithms, provides a variety of configuration strategies for the privacy mechanism, and then isolates and simplifies the critical logic that computes the final privacy guarantees. A key challenge is that training algorithms often require estimating many different quantities (vectors) from the same set of examples --- for example, gradients of different layers in a deep learning architecture, as well as metrics and batch normalization parameters. Each of these may have different properties like dimensionality, magnitude, and tolerance to noise. By extending previous work on the Moments Accountant for the subsampled Gaussian mechanism, we can provide privacy for such heterogeneous sets of vectors, while also structuring the approach to minimize software engineering challenges.",1
"As machine learning and data science applications grow ever more prevalent, there is an increased focus on data sharing and open data initiatives, particularly in the context of the African continent. Many argue that data sharing can support research and policy design to alleviate poverty, inequality, and derivative effects in Africa. Despite the fact that the datasets in question are often extracted from African communities, conversations around the challenges of accessing and sharing African data are too often driven by non-African stakeholders. These perspectives frequently employ a deficit narratives, often focusing on lack of education, training, and technological resources in the continent as the leading causes of friction in the data ecosystem. We argue that these narratives obfuscate and distort the full complexity of the African data sharing landscape. In particular, we use storytelling via fictional personas built from a series of interviews with African data experts to complicate dominant narratives and to provide counternarratives. Coupling these personas with research on data practices within the continent, we identify recurring barriers to data sharing as well as inequities in the distribution of data sharing benefits. In particular, we discuss issues arising from power imbalances resulting from the legacies of colonialism, ethno-centrism, and slavery, disinvestment in building trust, lack of acknowledgement of historical and present-day extractive practices, and Western-centric policies that are ill-suited to the African context. After outlining these problems, we discuss avenues for addressing them when sharing data generated in the continent.",1
"The purpose of the SIGIR 2019 workshop on Fairness, Accountability, Confidentiality, Transparency, and Safety (FACTS-IR) was to explore challenges in responsible information retrieval system development and deployment. To this end, the workshop aimed to crowdsource from the larger SIGIR community and draft an actionable research agenda on five key dimensions of responsible information retrieval: fairness, accountability, confidentiality, transparency, and safety. Such an agenda can guide others in the community that are interested in pursuing FACTS-IR research, as well as inform potential funders about relevant research avenues. The workshop brought together a diverse set of researchers and practitioners interested in contributing to the development of a technical research agenda for responsible information retrieval.",1
"Machine learning models in health care are often deployed in settings where it is important to protect patient privacy. In such settings, methods for differentially private (DP) learning provide a general-purpose approach to learn models with privacy guarantees. Modern methods for DP learning ensure privacy through the addition of calibrated noise. The resulting privacy-preserving models are unable to learn too much information about the tails of a data distribution, resulting in a loss of accuracy that can disproportionately affect small groups. In this paper, we study the effects of DP learning in health care. We use state-of-the-art methods for DP learning to train privacy-preserving models in clinical prediction tasks, including x-ray classification of images and mortality prediction in time series data. We use these models to perform a comprehensive empirical investigation of the tradeoffs between privacy, utility, robustness to dataset shift and fairness. Our results highlight lesser-known limitations of methods for DP learning in health care, models that exhibit steep tradeoffs between privacy and utility, and models whose predictions are disproportionately influenced by large demographic groups in the training data. We discuss the costs and benefits of differentially private learning in health care with open directions for differential privacy, machine learning and health care.",0
"Developing classification algorithms that are fair with respect to sensitive attributes of the data is an important problem due to the increased deployment of classification algorithms in societal contexts. Several recent works have focused on studying classification with respect to specific fairness metrics, modeled the corresponding fair classification problem as constrained optimization problems, and developed tailored algorithms to solve them. Despite this, there still remain important metrics for which there are no fair classifiers with theoretical guarantees; primarily because the resulting optimization problem is non-convex. The main contribution of this paper is a meta-algorithm for classification that can take as input a general class of fairness constraints with respect to multiple non-disjoint and multi-valued sensitive attributes, and which comes with provable guarantees. In particular, our algorithm can handle non-convex ""linear fractional"" constraints (which includes fairness constraints such as predictive parity) for which no prior algorithm was known. Key to our results is an algorithm for a family of classification problems with convex constraints along with a reduction from classification problems with linear fractional constraints to this family. Empirically, we observe that our algorithm is fast, can achieve near-perfect fairness with respect to various fairness metrics, and the loss in accuracy due to the imposed fairness constraints is often small.",0
"To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",0
"Surveys are a commonly used method within HCI research. While it initially appears easy and inexpensive to conduct surveys, overlooking key considerations in questionnaire design and the survey research process can yield skewed, biased, or entirely invalid survey results. Fortunately decades of academic research and analysis exist on optimizing the validity and reliability of survey data, from which this course will draw. To enable the creation of unbiased surveys, this course demonstrates questionnaire design biases and pitfalls, provides best practices for minimizing these, and reviews different uses of surveys within HCI.",1
"As machine learning systems become ubiquitous, there has been a surge of interest in interpretable machine learning: systems that provide explanation for their outputs. These explanations are often used to qualitatively assess other criteria such as safety or non-discrimination. However, despite the interest in interpretability, there is very little consensus on what interpretable machine learning is and how it should be measured. In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.",1
"This paper describes a testing methodology for quantitatively assessing the risk of \emph&lbrace;unintended memorization&rbrace; of rare or unique sequences in generative sequence models---a common type of neural network. Such models are sometimes trained on sensitive data (e.g., the text of users' private messages); our methodology allows deep-learning to choose configurations that minimize memorization during training, thereby  benefiting privacy.",1
"In email interfaces, providing users with reply suggestions may simplify or accelerate correspondence.  While the “success'” of such systems is typically quantified using the number of suggestions selected by users, this ignores the impact of social context, which can change how suggestions are perceived.  To address this, we developed a mixed-methods framework involving qualitative interviews and crowdsourced experiments to characterize problematic email reply suggestions.  Our interviews revealed issues with over-positive, dissonant, cultural, and gender-assuming replies, as well as contextual politeness.  In our experiments, crowdworkers assessed email scenarios that we generated and systematically controlled, showing that contextual factors like social ties and the presence of salutations impacts users’ perceptions of email correspondence.  These assessments created a novel dataset of human-authored corrections for problematic email replies. Our study highlights the social complexity of providing suggestions for email correspondence, raising issues that may apply to all social messaging systems.",1
"Counterfactual explanations are gaining prominence within technical, legal, and business circles as a way to explain the decisions of a machine learning model. These explanations share a trait with the long-established ""principal reason"" explanations required by U.S. credit laws: they both explain a decision by highlighting a set of features deemed most relevant---and withholding others. These ""feature-highlighting explanations"" have several desirable properties: They place no constraints on model complexity, do not require model disclosure, detail what needed to be different to achieve a different decision, and seem to automate compliance with the law. But they are far more complex and subjective than they appear. In this paper, we demonstrate that the utility of feature-highlighting explanations relies on a number of easily overlooked assumptions: that the recommended change in feature values clearly maps to real-world actions, that features can be made commensurate by looking only at the distribution of the training data, that features are only relevant to the decision at hand, and that the underlying model is stable over time, monotonic, and limited to binary outcomes. We then explore several consequences of acknowledging and attempting to address these assumptions, including a paradox in the way that feature-highlighting explanations aim to respect autonomy, the unchecked power that feature-highlighting explanations grant decision makers, and a tension between making these explanations useful and the need to keep the model hidden. While new research suggests several ways that feature-highlighting explanations can work around some of the problems that we identify, the disconnect between features in the model and actions in the real world---and the subjective choices necessary to compensate for this---must be understood before these techniques can be usefully implemented.",1
"AI technologies have the potential to dramatically impact the lives of people with disabilities (PWD). Indeed, improving the lives of PWD is a motivator for many state-of-the-art AI systems, such as automated speech recognition tools that can caption videos for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, or language prediction algorithms that can augment communication for people with speech or cognitive disabilities. However, widely deployed AI systems may not work properly for PWD, or worse, may actively discriminate against them. These considerations regarding fairness in AI for PWD have thus far received little attention. In this position paper, we identify potential areas of concern regarding how several AI technology categories may impact particular disability constituencies if care is not taken in their design, development, and testing. We intend for this risk assessment of how various classes of AI might interact with various classes of disability to provide a roadmap for future research that is needed to gather data, test these hypotheses, and build more inclusive algorithms.",1
"Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligence systems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literature in which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigators from outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source. In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.",1
"Accountability is widely understood as a goal for well governed computer systems, and is a sought-after value in many governance contexts. But how can it be achieved? Recent work on standards for governable artificial intelligence systems offers a related principle: traceability. Traceability requires establishing not only how a system worked but how it was created and for what purpose, in a way that explains why a system has particular dynamics or behaviors. It connects records of how the system was constructed and what the system did mechanically to the broader goals of governance, in a way that highlights human understanding of that mechanical operation and the decision processes underlying it. We examine the various ways in which the principle of traceability has been articulated in AI principles and other policy documents from around the world, distill from these a set of requirements on software systems driven by the principle, and systematize the technologies available to meet those requirements. From our map of requirements to supporting tools, techniques, and procedures, we identify gaps and needs separating what traceability requires from the toolbox available for practitioners. This map reframes existing discussions around accountability and transparency, using the principle of traceability to show how, when, and why transparency can be deployed to serve accountability goals and thereby improve the normative fidelity of systems and their development processes.",0
"Training and evaluation of fair classifiers is a challenging problem. This is partly due to the fact that most fairness metrics of interest depend on both the sensitive attribute information and label information of the data points. In many scenarios it is not possible to collect large datasets with such information. An alternate approach that is commonly used is to separately train an attribute classifier on data with sensitive attribute information, and then use it later in the ML pipeline to evaluate the bias of a given classifier. While such decoupling helps alleviate the problem of demographic scarcity, it raises several natural questions such as: how should the attribute classifier be trained?, and how should one use a given attribute classifier for accurate bias estimation? In this work we study this question from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We first experimentally demonstrate that the test accuracy of the attribute classifier is not always correlated with its effectiveness in bias estimation for a downstream model. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, we analyze an idealized theoretical model and characterize the structure of the optimal classifier. Our analysis has surprising and counter-intuitive implications where in certain regimes one might want to distribute the error of the attribute classifier as unevenly as possible among the different subgroups. Based on our analysis we develop heuristics for both training and using attribute classifiers for bias estimation in the data scarce regime. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real and simulated data.",1
"User needs vary significantly across different tasks, and therefore their queries will also vary significantly in their expressiveness and semantics. Many studies have been proposed to model such query diversity by obtaining query types and building query-dependent ranking models. To obtain query types, these studies typically require either a labeled query dataset or clicks from multiple users aggregated over the same document. These techniques, however, are not applicable when manual query labeling is not viable, and aggregated clicks are unavailable due to the private nature of the document collection, e.g., in personal search scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of how to obtain query type in an unsupervised fashion and how to leverage this information using query-dependent ranking models in personal search. We first develop a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on truncated SVD and varimax rotation to obtain coarse-to-fine query types. Then, we propose three query-dependent ranking models, including two neural models that leverage query type information as additional features, and one novel multi-task neural model that is trained to simultaneously rank documents and predict query types. We evaluate our ranking models using the click data collected from one of the worldâs largest personal search engines. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task model can significantly outperform the baseline neural models, which either do not incorporate query type information or just simply feed query type as an additional feature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of query-dependent multi-task learning in personal search ranking.",1
"Research within the social sciences and humanities has long characterized the work of data science as a sociotechnical process, comprised of a set of logics and techniques that are inseparable from specific social norms, expectations and contexts of development and use. Yet all too often the assumptions and premises underlying data analysis remain unexamined, even in contemporary debates about the fairness of algorithmic systems. This blindspot exists in part because the methodological toolkit used to evaluate the fairness of algorithmic systems remains limited to a narrow set of computational and legal modes of analysis. In this paper, we expand on Elish and Boyd's [17] call for data scientists to develop more robust frameworks for understanding their work as situated practice by examining a specific methodological debate within the field of anthropology, frequently referred to as the practice of ""studying up"". We reflect on the contributions that the call to ""study up"" has made in the field of anthropology before making the case that the field of algorithmic fairness would similarly benefit from a reorientation ""upward"". A case study from our own work illustrates what it looks like to reorient one's research questions ""up"" in a high-profile debate regarding the fairness of an algorithmic system - namely, pretrial risk assessment in American criminal law. We discuss the limitations of contemporary fairness discourse with regard to pretrial risk assessment before highlighting the insights gained when we reframe our research questions to focus on those who inhabit positions of power and authority within the U.S. court system. Finally, we reflect on the challenges we have encountered in implementing data science projects that ""study up"". In the process, we surface new insights and questions about what it means to ethically engage in data science work that directly confronts issues of power and authority.",0
"Conventional algorithmic fairness is West-centric, as seen in its subgroups, values, and methods. In this paper, we de-center algorithmic fairness and analyse AI power in India. Based on 36 qualitative interviews and a discourse analysis of algorithmic deployments in India, we find that several assumptions of algorithmic fairness are challenged. We find that in India, data is not always reliable due to socio-economic factors, ML makers appear to follow double standards, and AI evokes unquestioning aspiration. We contend that localising model fairness alone can be window dressing in India, where the distance between models and oppressed communities is large. Instead, we re-imagine algorithmic fairness in India and provide a roadmap to re-contextualise data and models, empower oppressed communities, and enable Fair-ML ecosystems.",1
"The study of fairness in intelligent decision systems has mostly ignored long-term influence on the underlying population. Yet fairness considerations (e.g. affirmative action) have often the implicit goal of achieving balance among groups within the population. The most basic notion of balance is eventual equality between the qualifications of the groups. How can we incorporate influence dynamics in decision making? How well do dynamics-oblivious fairness policies fare in terms of reaching equality? In this paper, we propose a simple yet revealing model that encompasses (1) a selection process where an institution chooses from multiple groups according to their qualifications so as to maximize an institutional utility and (2) dynamics that govern the evolution of the groups' qualifications according to the imposed policies. We focus on demographic parity as the formalism of affirmative action. We first give conditions under which an unconstrained policy reaches equality on its own. In this case, surprisingly, imposing demographic parity may break equality. When it doesn't, one would expect the additional constraint to reduce utility, however, we show that utility may in fact increase. In real world scenarios, unconstrained policies do not lead to equality. In such cases, we show that although imposing demographic parity may remedy it, there is a danger that groups settle at a worse set of qualifications. As a silver lining, we also identify when the constraint not only leads to equality, but also improves all groups. These cases and trade-offs are instrumental in determining when and how imposing demographic parity can be beneficial in selection processes, both for the institution and for society on the long run.",0
"Word embeddings are a widely used set of natural language processing techniques that map words to vectors of real numbers. These vectors are used to improve the quality of generative and predictive models. Recent studies demonstrate that word embeddings contain and amplify biases present in data, such as stereotypes and prejudice. In this study, we provide a complete overview of bias in word embeddings. We develop a new technique for bias detection for gendered languages and use it to compare bias in embeddings trained on Wikipedia and on political social media data. We investigate bias diffusion and prove that existing biases are transferred to further machine learning models. We test two techniques for bias mitigation and show that the generally proposed methodology for debiasing models at the embeddings level is insufficient. Finally, we employ biased word embeddings and illustrate that they can be used for the detection of similar biases in new data. Given that word embeddings are widely used by commercial companies, we discuss the challenges and required actions towards fair algorithmic implementations and applications.",0
"As AI plays an increasing role in the financial services industry, it is essential that financial services organizations anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences, including fairness-related harms, such as denying people services, initiating predatory lending, amplifying gender or racial biases, or violating laws such as the United States’ Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). To address these kinds of harms, fairness must be explicitly prioritized throughout the AI development and deployment lifecycle.",1
"If our models are used in new or unexpected cases, do we know if they will make fair predictions? Previously, researchers developed ways to debias a model for a single problem domain. However, this is often not how models are trained and used in practice. For example, labels and demographics (sensitive attributes) are often hard to observe, resulting in auxiliary or synthetic data to be used for training, and proxies of the sensitive attribute to be used for evaluation of fairness. A model trained for one setting may be picked up and used in many others, particularly as is common with pre-training and cloud APIs. Despite the pervasiveness of these complexities, remarkably little work in the fairness literature has theoretically examined these issues. We frame all of these settings as domain adaptation problems: how can we use what we have learned in a source domain to debias in a new target domain, without directly debiasing on the target domain as if it is a completely new problem? We offer new theoretical guarantees of improving fairness across domains, and offer a modeling approach to transfer to data-sparse target domains. We give empirical results validating the theory and showing that these modeling approaches can improve fairness metrics with less data.",1
"The recent adoption of machine learning models in high-risk settings such as medicine has increased demand for developments in privacy and fairness. Rebalancing skewed datasets using synthetic data created by generative adversarial networks (GANs) has shown potential to mitigate disparate impact on minoritized subgroups. However, such generative models are subject to privacy attacks that can expose sensitive data from the training dataset. Differential privacy (DP) is the current leading solution for privacy-preserving machine learning. Differentially private GANs (DP GANs) are often considered a potential solution for improving model fairness while maintaining privacy of sensitive training data. We investigate the impact of using synthetic images from DP GANs on downstream classification model utility and fairness. We demonstrate that existing DP GANs cannot simultaneously maintain model utility, privacy, and fairness. The images generated from GAN models trained with DP exhibit extreme decreases in image quality and utility which leads to poor downstream classification model performance. Our evaluation highlights the friction between privacy, fairness, and utility and how this directly translates into real loss of performance and representation in common machine learning settings. Our results show that additional work improving the utility and fairness of DP generative models is required before they can be utilized as a potential solution to privacy and fairness issues stemming from lack of diversity in the training dataset.",1
"Ride hailing platforms, such as Uber, Lyft, Ola or DiDi, have traditionally focused on the satisfaction of the passengers, or on boosting successful business transactions. However, recent studies provide a multitude of reasons to worry about the drivers in the ride hailing ecosystem. The concerns range from bad working conditions and worker manipulation to discrimination against minorities. With the sharing economy ecosystem growing, more and more drivers financially depend on online platforms and their algorithms to secure a living. It is pertinent to ask what a fair distribution of income on such platforms is and what power and means the platform has in shaping these distributions.",1
"Many powerful computing technologies rely on implicit and explicit data contributions from the public. This dependency suggests a potential source of leverage for the public in its relationship with technology companies: by reducing, stopping, redirecting, or otherwise manipulating data contributions, the public can reduce the effectiveness of many lucrative technologies. In this paper, we synthesize emerging research that seeks to better understand and help people action this data leverage. Drawing on prior work in areas including machine learning, human-computer interaction, and fairness and accountability in computing, we present a framework for understanding data leverage that highlights new opportunities to change technology company behavior related to privacy, economic inequality, content moderation and other areas of societal concern. Our framework also points towards ways that policymakers can bolster data leverage as a means of changing the balance of power between the public and tech companies.",0
"Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately calibrate human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.",1
"Subset selection algorithms are ubiquitous in AI-driven applications, including, online recruiting portals and image search engines, so it is imperative that these tools are not discriminatory on the basis of protected attributes such as gender or race. Currently, fair subset selection algorithms assume that the protected attributes are known as part of the dataset. However, protected attributes may be noisy due to errors during data collection or if they are imputed (as is often the case in real-world settings). While a wide body of work addresses the effect of noise on the performance of machine learning algorithms, its effect on fairness remains largely unexamined. We find that in the presence of noisy protected attributes, in attempting to increase fairness without considering noise, one can, in fact, decrease the fairness of the result! Towards addressing this, we consider an existing noise model in which there is probabilistic information about the protected attributes (e.g., [19, 32, 44, 56]), and ask is fair selection possible under noisy conditions? We formulate a ""denoised"" selection problem which functions for a large class of fairness metrics; given the desired fairness goal, the solution to the denoised problem violates the goal by at most a small multiplicative amount with high probability. Although this denoised problem turns out to be NP-hard, we give a linear-programming based approximation algorithm for it. We evaluate this approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our empirical results show that this approach can produce subsets which significantly improve the fairness metrics despite the presence of noisy protected attributes, and, compared to prior noise-oblivious approaches, has better Pareto-tradeoffs between utility and fairness.",0
"Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.",0
"Measures of algorithmic bias can be roughly classified into four categories, distinguished by the conditional probabilistic dependencies to which they are sensitive. First, measures of ""procedural bias"" diagnose bias when the score returned by an algorithm is probabilistically dependent on a sensitive class variable (e.g. race or sex). Second, measures of ""outcome bias"" capture probabilistic dependence between class variables and the outcome for each subject (e.g. parole granted or loan denied). Third, measures of ""behavior-relative error bias"" capture probabilistic dependence between class variables and the algorithmic score, conditional on target behaviors (e.g. recidivism or loan default). Fourth, measures of ""score-relative error bias"" capture probabilistic dependence between class variables and behavior, conditional on score. Several recent discussions have demonstrated a tradeoff between these different measures of algorithmic bias, and at least one recent paper has suggested conditions under which tradeoffs may be minimized. In this paper we use the machinery of causal graphical models to show that, under standard assumptions, the underlying causal relations among variables forces some tradeoffs. We delineate a number of normative considerations that are encoded in different measures of bias, with reference to the philosophical literature on the wrongfulness of disparate treatment and disparate impact. While both kinds of error bias are nominally motivated by concern to avoid disparate impact, we argue that consideration of causal structures shows that these measures are better understood as complicated and unreliable measures of procedural biases (i.e. disparate treatment). Moreover, while procedural bias is indicative of disparate treatment, we show that the measure of procedural bias one ought to adopt is dependent on the account of the wrongfulness of disparate treatment one endorses. Finally, given that neither score-relative nor behavior-relative measures of error bias capture the relevant normative considerations, we suggest that error bias proper is best measured by score-based measures of accuracy, such as the Brier score.",0
"Addressing digital security and privacy issues can be particularly difficult for users who face challenging circumstances. We performed semi-structured interviews with residents and staff at 4 transitional homeless shelters in the U.S. San Francisco Bay Area (n=15 residents, 3 staff) to explore their digital security and privacy challenges. Based on these interviews, we outline four tough times themes -- challenges experienced by our financially insecure participants that impacted their digital security and privacy -- which included: (1) limited financial resources, (2) limited access to reliable devices and Internet, (3) untrusted relationships, and (4) ongoing stress. We provide examples of how each theme impacts digital security and privacy practices and needs. We then use these themes to provide a framework outlining opportunities for technology creators to better support users facing security and privacy challenges related to financial insecurity.",1
"Advances in machine learning have led to broad deployment of systems with impressive performance on important problems. Nonetheless, these systems can be induced to make errors on data that are surprisingly similar to examples the learned system handles correctly. The existence of these errors raises a variety of questions about out-of-sample generalization and whether bad actors might use such examples to abuse deployed systems. As a result of these security concerns, there has been a flurry of recent papers proposing algorithms to defend against such malicious perturbations of correctly handled examples. It is unclear how such misclassifications represent a different kind of security problem than other errors, or even other attacker-produced examples that have no specific relationship to an uncorrupted input. In this paper, we argue that adversarial example defense papers have, to date, mostly considered abstract, toy games that do not relate to any specific security concern. Furthermore, defense papers have not yet precisely described all the abilities and limitations of attackers that would be relevant in practical security. Towards this end, we establish a taxonomy of motivations, constraints, and abilities for more plausible adversaries. Finally, we provide a series of recommendations outlining a path forward for future work to more clearly articulate the threat model and perform more meaningful evaluation.",1
"Social data in digital form, including user-generated content, expressed or implicit relations between people, and behavioral traces, are at the core of popular applications and platforms, driving the research agenda of many researchers. The promises of social data are many, including understanding “what the world thinks” about a social issue, brand, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics and practitioners have warned against the naive usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked. This paper recognizes the rigor with which these issues are addressed by different researchers varies across a wide range. We identify a variety of menaces in the practices around social data use, and organize them in a framework that helps to identify them.",1
"How should we decide which fairness criteria or definitions to adopt in machine learning systems? To answer this question, we must study the fair- ness preferences of actual users of machine learn- ing systems. Stringent parity constraints on treat- ment or impact can come with trade-offs, and may not even be preferred by the social groups in question (Zafar et al., 2017). Thus it might be beneficial to elicit what the groupâs prefer- ences are, rather than rely on a priori defined mathematical fairness constraints. Simply asking for self-reported rankings of users is challenging because research has shown that there are often gaps between peopleâs stated and actual prefer- ences(Bernheim et al., 2013).",1
"Algorithmic impact assessments (AIAs) are an emergent form of accountability for organizations that build and deploy automated decision-support systems. They are modeled after impact assessments in other domains. Our study of the history of impact assessments shows that ""impacts"" are an evaluative construct that enable actors to identify and ameliorate harms experienced because of a policy decision or system. Every domain has different expectations and norms around what constitutes impacts and harms, how potential harms are rendered as impacts of a particular undertaking, who is responsible for conducting such assessments, and who has the authority to act on them to demand changes to that undertaking. By examining proposals for AIAs in relation to other domains, we find that there is a distinct risk of constructing algorithmic impacts as organizationally understandable metrics that are nonetheless inappropriately distant from the harms experienced by people, and which fall short of building the relationships required for effective accountability. As impact assessments become a commonplace process for evaluating harms, the FAccT community, in its efforts to address this challenge, should A) understand impacts as objects that are co-constructed accountability relationships, B) attempt to construct impacts as close as possible to actual harms, and C) recognize that accountability governance requires the input of various types of expertise and affected communities. We conclude with lessons for assembling cross-expertise consensus for the co-construction of impacts and building robust accountability relationships.",0
"As the public seeks greater accountability and transparency from machine learning algorithms, the research literature on methods to explain algorithms and their outputs has rapidly expanded. Feature importance methods form a popular class of explanation methods. In this paper, we apply the lens of feminist epistemology to recent feature importance research. We investigate what epistemic values are implicitly embedded in feature importance methods and how or whether they are in conflict with feminist epistemology. We offer some suggestions on how to conduct research on explanations that respects feminist epistemic values, taking into account the importance of social context, the epistemic privileges of subjugated knowers, and adopting more interactional ways of knowing",1
"Machine learning models often need to satisfy many real-world policy goals and capture some kinds of side information. We show that many such goals can be mathematically expressed as constraints on the modelâs predictions on the data, which we call rate constraints. In this paper, we study the specific problem of training non-convex models subject to these rate constraints (which are non-convex and non-differentiable), and the general problem of constrained optimization of possibly non-convex objectives with possibly non-convex and non-differentiable constraints. In the non-convex setting, the Lagrangian may not have an equilibrium to converge to, and thus using the standard approach of Lagrange multipliers may fail as a deterministic solution may not even exist. Furthermore, if the constraints are non-differentiable, then one cannot optimize the Lagrangian with gradient-based methods by definition. To solve these issues, we present the proxy-Lagrangian, which leads to an algorithm that produces a stochastic classifier with theoretical guarantees by playing a two-player non-zero-sum game. The first player minimizes external regret in terms of a differentiable relaxation of the constraints and the second player enforces the original constraints by minimizing swap-regret: this leads to finding a solution concept which we call a semi-coarse correlated equilibrium which we interestingly show corresponds to an approximately optimal and feasible solution to the constrained optimization problem. We then give a procedure which shrinks the randomized solution down to one that is a mixture of at most m + 1 deterministic solutions. This culminates into end-to-end procedures which can provably solve non-convex constrained optimization problems with possibly non-differentiable and non-convex constraints. We provide extensive experimental results on benchmark and real-world problems, enforcing a broad range of policy goals including different fairness metrics, and other goals on accuracy, coverage, recall, and churn.",1
"In industrial computer vision, discretionary decisions surrounding the production of image training data remain widely undocumented. Recent research taking issue with such opacity has proposed standardized processes for dataset documentation. In this paper, we expand this space of inquiry through fieldwork at two data processing companies and thirty interviews with data workers and computer vision practitioners. We identify four key issues that hinder the documentation of image datasets and the effective retrieval of production contexts. Finally, we propose reflexivity, understood as a collective consideration of social and intellectual factors that lead to praxis, as a necessary precondition for documentation. Reflexive documentation can help to expose the contexts, relations, routines, and power structures that shape data.",1
"Search engines, by ranking a few links ahead of million others based on opaque rules, open themselves up to criticism of bias. Previous research has focused on measuring political bias of search engine algorithms to detect possible search engine manipulation effects on voters or unbalanced ideological representation in search results. Insofar that these concerns are related to the principle of fairness, this notion of fairness can be seen as explicitly oriented toward election candidates or political processes and only implicitly oriented toward the public at large. Thus, we ask the following research question: how should an auditing framework that is explicitly centered on the principle of ensuring and maximizing fairness for the public (i.e., voters) operate? To answer this question, we qualitatively explore four datasets about elections and politics in the United States: 1) a survey of eligible U.S. voters about their information needs ahead of the 2018 U.S. elections, 2) a dataset of biased political phrases used in a large-scale Google audit ahead of the 2018 U.S. election, 3) Google's ""related searches"" phrases for two groups of political candidates in the 2018 U.S. election (one group is composed entirely of women), and 4) autocomplete suggestions and result pages for a set of searches on the day of a statewide election in the U.S. state of Virginia in 2019. We find that voters have much broader information needs than the search engine audit literature has accounted for in the past, and that relying on political science theories of voter modeling provides a good starting point for informing the design of voter-centered audits.",0
"Several recent advancements in Machine Learning involve blackbox models: algorithms that do not provide human-understandable explanations in support of their decisions. This limitation hampers the fairness, accountability and transparency of these models; the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to solve this problem providing human-understandable explanations for black-box models. However, healthcare datasets (and the related learning tasks) often present peculiar features, such as sequential data, multi-label predictions, and links to structured background knowledge. In this paper, we introduce Doctor XAI, a model-agnostic explainability technique able to deal with multi-labeled, sequential, ontology-linked data. We focus on explaining Doctor AI, a multilabel classifier which takes as input the clinical history of a patient in order to predict the next visit. Furthermore, we show how exploiting the temporal dimension in the data and the domain knowledge encoded in the medical ontology improves the quality of the mined explanations.",0
"In response to algorithmic unfairness embedded in sociotechnical systems, significant attention has been focused on the contents of machine learning datasets which have revealed biases towards white, cisgender, male, and Western data subjects. In contrast, comparatively less attention has been paid to the histories, values, and norms embedded in such datasets. In this work, we outline a research program - a genealogy of machine learning data - for investigating how and why these datasets have been created, what and whose values influence the choices of data to collect, the contextual and contingent conditions of their creation. We describe the ways in which benchmark datasets in machine learning operate as infrastructure and pose four research questions for these datasets. This interrogation forces us to ""bring the people back in"" by aiding us in understanding the labor embedded in dataset construction, and thereby presenting new avenues of contestation for other researchers encountering the data.",1
