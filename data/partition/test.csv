"There is a growing body of work that proposes methods for mitigating bias in machine learning systems. These methods typically rely on access to protected attributes such as race, gender, or age. However, this raises two significant challenges: (1) protected attributes may not be available or it may not be legal to use them, and (2) it is often desirable to simultaneously consider multiple protected attributes, as well as their intersections. In the context of mitigating bias in occupation classiﬁcation, we propose a method for discouraging correlation between the predicted probability of an individual’s true occupation and a word embedding of their name. This method leverages the societal biases that are encoded in word embeddings, eliminating the need for access to protected attributes. Crucially, it only requires access to individuals’ names at training time and not at deployment time. We evaluate two variations of our proposed method using a large-scale data set of online biographies. We ﬁnd that both variations simultaneously reduce race and gender biases, with almost no reduction in the classiﬁer’s overall true positive rate.",1
"We improve the recently-proposed ``MixMatch'' semi-supervised learning algorithm by introducing two new techniques: distribution alignment and augmentation anchoring. Distribution alignment encourages the marginal distribution of predictions on unlabeled data to be close to the marginal distribution of groundtruth labels. Augmentation anchoring feeds multiple strongly augmented versions of an input into the model and encourages each output to be close to the prediction for a weakly-augmented version of the same input. To produce strong augmentations, we propose a variant of AutoAugment which learns the augmentation policy while the model is being trained. Our new algorithm, dubbed ReMixMatch, is significantly more data-efficient than prior work, requiring between 5x and 16x less data to reach the same accuracy. For example, on CIFAR10 with 250 labeled examples we reach 93.73% accuracy (compared to MixMatchâs accuracy of 93.58% with 4,000 examples) and a median accuracy of 84.92% with just four labels per class. We make our code and data open-source at https://github.com/google-research/remixmatch.",1
"Perhaps the most controversial questions in the study of online platforms today surround the extent to which platforms can intervene to reduce the societal ills perpetrated on them. Up for debate is whether there exist any effective and lasting interventions a platform can adopt to address, e.g., online bullying, or if other, more far-reaching change is necessary to address such problems. Empirical work is critical to addressing such questions. But it is also challenging, because it is time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes limited to the questions companies are willing to ask. To help focus and inform this empirical work, we here propose an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. As an application, we analyze the impact of a set of interventions on a simulated online dating platform on the lack of long-term interracial relationships in an artificial society. In the real world, a lack of interracial relationships are a critical vehicle through which inequality is maintained. Our work shows that many previously hypothesized interventions online dating platforms could take to increase the number of interracial relationships from their website have limited effects, and that the effectiveness of any intervention is subject to assumptions about sociocultural structure. Further, interventions that are effective in increasing diversity in long-term relationships are at odds with platforms' profit-oriented goals. At a general level, the present work shows the value of using an ABM approach to help understand the potential effects and side effects of different interventions that a platform could take.",0
"Increasingly, programming tasks involve automating and deploying sensitive decision-making processes that may have adverse impacts on individuals or groups of people. The issue of fairness in automated decision-making has thus become a major problem, attracting interdisciplinary attention. In this work, we aim to make fairness a first-class concern in programming. Specifically, we propose fairness-aware programming, where programmers can state fairness expectations natively in their code, and have a runtime system monitor decision-making and report violations of fairness. We present a rich and general specification language that allows a programmer to specify a range of fairness definitions from the literature, as well as others. As the decision-making program executes, the runtime maintains statistics on the decisions made and incrementally checks whether the fairness definitions have been violated, reporting such violations to the developer. The advantages of this approach are two fold: (i) Enabling declarative mathematical specifications of fairness in the programming language simplifies the process of checking fairness, as the programmer does not have to write ad hoc code for maintaining statistics. (ii) Compared to existing techniques for checking and ensuring fairness, our approach monitors a decision-making program in the wild, which may be running on a distribution that is unlike the dataset on which a classifier was trained and tested. We describe an implementation of our proposed methodology as a library in the Python programming language and illustrate its use on case studies from the algorithmic fairness literature.",0
"We consider the problem of learning representations that achieve group and subgroup fairness with respect to multiple sensitive attributes. Taking inspiration from the disentangled representation learning literature, we propose an algorithm for learning compact representations of datasets that are useful for reconstruction and prediction, but are also \emph&lbrace;flexibly fair&rbrace;, meaning they can be easily modified at test time to achieve subgroup demographic parity with respect to multiple sensitive attributes and their conjunctions. We show empirically that the resulting encoder---which does not require the sensitive attributes for inference---allows for the adaptation of a single representation to a variety of fair classification tasks with new target labels and subgroup definitions.",1
"We study the problem of learning fair prediction models for unseen test sets distributed differently from the train set. Stability against changes in data distribution is an important mandate for responsible deployment of models. The domain adaptation literature addresses this concern, albeit with the notion of stability limited to that of prediction accuracy. We identify sufficient conditions under which stable models, both in terms of prediction accuracy and fairness, can be learned. Using the causal graph describing the data and the anticipated shifts, we specify an approach based on feature selection that exploits conditional independencies in the data to estimate accuracy and fairness metrics for the test set. We show that for specific fairness definitions, the resulting model satisfies a form of worst-case optimality. In context of a healthcare task, we illustrate the advantages of the approach in making more equitable decisions.",0
"Real-world machine learning applications often have complex test metrics, and may have training and test data that are not identically distributed. Motivated by known connections between complex test metrics and cost-weighted learning, we propose addressing these issues by using a weighted loss function with a standard loss, where the weights on the training examples are learned to optimize the test metric on a validation set. These metric-optimized example weights can be learned for any test metric, including black box and customized ones for specific applications. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method on diverse public benchmark datasets and real-world applications. We also provide a generalization bound for the method.",1
"Machine learning models are often susceptible to adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Even small perturbations can cause state-of-the-art classifiers with high âstandardâ accuracy to produce an incorrect prediction with high confidence. To better understand this phenomenon, we study adversarially robust learning from the viewpoint of generalization. We show that already in a simple natural data model, the sample complexity of robust learning can be significantly larger than that of âstandardâ learning. This gap is information theoretic and holds irrespective of the training algorithm or the model family. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on popular image classification datasets and show that a similar gap exists here as well. We postulate that the difficulty of training robust classifiers stems, at least partially, from this inherently larger sample complexity.",1
"Many modern recommender systems train their models based on a large amount of implicit user feedback data. Due to the inherent bias in this data (e.g., position bias), learning from it directly can lead to suboptimal models. Recently, unbiased learning was proposed to address such problems by leveraging counterfactual techniques like inverse propensity weighting (IPW). In these methods, propensity scores estimation is usually limited to item's display position in a single user interface (UI).",1
"Differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) has been extremely effective both theoretically, and in practice, for solving private empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems. In this paper, we focus on understanding the impact of the clipping norm, a critical component of DP-GD, on its convergence. We provide the first formal convergence analysis of clipped DP-GD.",1
"Motivated by concerns surrounding the fairness effects of sharing and transferring fair machine learning tools, we propose two algorithms: Fairness Warnings and Fair-MAML. The first is a model-agnostic algorithm that provides interpretable boundary conditions for when a fairly trained model may not behave fairly on similar but slightly different tasks within a given domain. The second is a fair meta-learning approach to train models that can be quickly fine-tuned to specific tasks from only a few number of sample instances while balancing fairness and accuracy. We demonstrate experimentally the individual utility of each model using relevant baselines and provide the first experiment to our knowledge of K-shot fairness, i.e. training a fair model on a new task with only K data points. Then, we illustrate the usefulness of both algorithms as a combined method for training models from a few data points on new tasks while using Fairness Warnings as interpretable boundary conditions under which the newly trained model may not be fair.",0
"Formulating data science problems is an uncertain and difficult process. It requires various forms of discretionary work to translate high-level objectives or strategic goals into tractable problems, necessitating, among other things, the identification of appropriate target variables and proxies. While these choices are rarely self-evident, normative assessments of data science projects often take them for granted, even though different translations can raise profoundly different ethical concerns. Whether we consider a data science project fair often has as much to do with the formulation of the problem as any property of the resulting model. Building on six months of ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team---and channeling ideas from sociology and history of science, critical data studies, and early writing on knowledge discovery in databases---we describe the complex set of actors and activities involved in problem formulation. Our research demonstrates that the specification and operationalization of the problem are always negotiated and elastic, and rarely worked out with explicit normative considerations in mind. In so doing, we show that careful accounts of everyday data science work can help us better understand how and why data science problems are posed in certain ways---and why specific formulations prevail in practice, even in the face of what might seem like normatively preferable alternatives. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings, arguing that effective normative interventions will require attending to the practical work of problem formulation.",0
"Pre-trial risk assessment tools are used to make recommendations to judges about appropriate conditions of pre-trial supervision for people who have been arrested. Increasingly, there is concern about whether these models are operating fairly, including concerns about whether the models' input factors are fair measures of one's criminal activity. In this paper, we assess the impact of booking charges that do not result in a conviction on a popular risk assessment tool, the Arnold Public Safety Assessment. Using data from a pilot run of the tool in San Francisco, CA, we find that booking charges that do not result in a conviction (i.e. charges that are dropped or end in an acquittal) increased the recommended level of pre-trial supervision in around 27% of cases evaluated by the tool.",0
"Article 5(1)(c) of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that “personal data shall be […] adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’)”. To date, the legal and computational definitions of ‘purpose limitation’ and ‘data minimization’ remain largely unclear. In particular, the interpretation of these principles is an open issue for information access systems that optimize for user experience through personalization and do not strictly require personal data collection for the delivery of basic service.",1
"Machine learning can be used to train a model that accurately represents the data on which it is trained. The most common loss functions minimized by gradient descent involve accuracy. However, modeling the training data optimally requires accurately modeling any undesirable biases present in that training data. One task which easily demonstrates this phenomenon is word embeddings learned from standard corpora. When such word embeddings are used to perform tasks like analogy completion, the bias in the word embeddings propagates to the predicted analogy completions. Ideally we would like to remove the biased information which might impact task performance while retaining as much other semantic information as possible. We present here a method for debiasing networks using an adversary. First we formalize this problem by describing the nature of the input to our network X, describing the prediction which is desired Y and the protected variable Z. The objective then becomes to maximize the primary networkâs ability to predict Y while minimizing the adversaryâs ability to use that prediction to predict Z. When applied to analogy completion this method results in embeddings which are still quite useful for performing analogy completion but without producing predictions impacted by bias prediction. When applied to a categorization task such as the one in the UCI Adult Dataset it results in a predictive model that maintains accuracy while ensuring equality of odds. This method is quite flexible and is applicable to any problem set which is expressible as a model which predicts a label Y using an input X while trying to be fair with respect to a protected variable Z.",1
"How do we learn from biased data? Historical datasets often reflect historical prejudices; sensitive or protected attributes may affect the observed treatments and outcomes. Classification algorithms tasked with predicting outcomes accurately from these datasets tend to replicate these biases. We advocate a causal modeling approach to learning from biased data, exploring the relationship between fair classification and intervention. We propose a causal model in which the sensitive attribute confounds both the treatment and the outcome. Building on prior work in deep learning and generative modeling, we describe how to learn the parameters of this causal model from observational data alone, even in the presence of unobserved confounders. We show experimentally that fairness-aware causal modeling provides better estimates of the causal effects between the sensitive attribute, the treatment, and the outcome. We further present evidence that estimating these causal effects can help learn policies that are both more accurate and fair, when presented with a historically biased dataset.",0
"In this paper, we develop a taxonomy of conceptual models and proxy data used for digital analysis of human emotional expression and outline how the combinations and permutations of these models and data impact their incorporation into artificial intelligence (AI) systems. We argue we should not take computer scientists at their word that the paradigms for human emotions they have developed internally and adapted from other disciplines can produce ground truth about human emotions; instead, we ask how different conceptualizations of what emotions are, and how they can be sensed, measured and transformed into data, shape the ethical and social implications of these AI systems.",0
"The explainable AI literature contains multiple notions of what an explanation is and what desiderata explanations should satisfy. One implicit source of disagreement is how far the explanations should reflect real patterns in the data or the world. This disagreement underlies debates about other desiderata, such as how robust explanations are to slight perturbations in the input data. I argue that robustness is desirable to the extent that we're concerned about finding real patterns in the world. The import of real patterns differs according to the problem context. In some contexts, non-robust explanations can constitute a moral hazard. By being clear about the extent to which we care about capturing real patterns, we can also determine whether the Rashomon Effect is a boon or a bane.",1
"Much of the debate on the impact of algorithms is concerned with fairness, defined as the absence of discrimination for individuals with the same ""merit."" Drawing on the theory of justice, we argue that leading notions of fairness suffer from three key limitations: they legitimize inequalities justified by ""merit;"" they are narrowly bracketed, considering only differences of treatment within the algorithm; and they consider between-group and not within-group differences. We contrast this fairness-based perspective with two alternate perspectives: the first focuses on inequality and the causal impact of algorithms and the second on the distribution of power. We formalize these perspectives drawing on techniques from causal inference and empirical economics, and characterize when they give divergent evaluations. We present theoretical results and empirical examples which demonstrate this tension. We further use these insights to present a guide for algorithmic auditing and discuss the importance of inequality- and power-centered frameworks in algorithmic decision-making.",0
"Interactions between bids to show ads online can lead to an advertiser's ad being shown to more men than women even when the advertiser does not target towards men. We design bidding strategies that advertisers can use to avoid such emergent discrimination without having to modify the auction mechanism. We mathematically analyze the strategies to determine the additional cost to the advertiser for avoiding discrimination, proving our strategies to be optimal in some settings. We use simulations to understand other settings.",0
"AI technology offers opportunities to expand virtual and physical access for people with disabilities. However, an important part of bringing these opportunities to fruition is ensuring that upcoming AI technology works well for people with a wide range of abilities. In this paper, we identify the lack of data from disabled populations as one of the challenges to training and benchmarking fair and inclusive AI systems. As a potential solution, we envision an online infrastructure that can enable large-scale, remote data contributions from disability communities. We investigate the motivations, concerns, and challenges that people with disabilities might experience when asked to collect and upload various forms of AI-relevant data through a semi-structured interview and an online survey that simulated a data contribution process by collecting example data files through an online portal. Based on our findings, we outline design guidelines for developers creating online infrastructures for gathering data from people with disabilities.",1
"We identify and explore differential access to population-level signaling (also known as information design) as a source of unequal access to opportunity. A population-level signaler has potentially noisy observations of a binary type for each member of a population and, based on this, produces a signal about each member. A decision-maker infers types from signals and accepts those individuals whose type is high in expectation. We assume the signaler of the disadvantaged population reveals her observations to the decision-maker, whereas the signaler of the advantaged population forms signals strategically. We study the expected utility of the populations as measured by the fraction of accepted members, as well as the false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR). We first show the intuitive results that for a fixed environment, the advantaged population has higher expected utility, higher FPR, and lower FNR, than the disadvantaged one (despite having identical population quality), and that more accurate observations improve the expected utility of the advantaged population while harming that of the disadvantaged one. We next explore the introduction of a publicly-observable signal, such as a test score, as a potential intervention. Our main finding is that this natural intervention, intended to reduce the inequality between the populations' utilities, may actually exacerbate it in settings where observations and test scores are noisy.",1
"Computer vision technology is being used by many but remains representative of only a few. People have reported misbehavior of computer vision models, including offensive prediction results and lower performance for underrepresented groups. Current computer vision models are typically developed using datasets consisting of manually annotated images or videos; the data and label distributions in these datasets are critical to the models' behavior. In this paper, we examine ImageNet, a large-scale ontology of images that has spurred the development of many modern computer vision methods. We consider three key factors within the person subtree of ImageNet that may lead to problematic behavior in downstream computer vision technology: (1) the stagnant concept vocabulary of WordNet, (2) the attempt at exhaustive illustration of all categories with images, and (3) the inequality of representation in the images within concepts. We seek to illuminate the root causes of these concerns and take the first steps to mitigate them constructively.",0
"Supporting model interpretability for complex phenomena where annotators can legitimately disagree, such as emotion recognition, is a challenging machine learning task. In this work, we show that explicitly quantifying the uncertainty in such settings has interpretability benefits. We use a simple modification of a classical network inference using Monte Carlo dropout to give measures of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. We identify a significant correlation between aleatoric uncertainty and human annotator disagreement (r â .3). Additionally, we demonstrate how difficult and subjective training samples can be identified using aleatoric uncertainty and how epistemic uncertainty can reveal data bias that could result in unfair predictions. We identify the total uncertainty as a suitable surrogate for model calibration, i.e. the degree we can trust model's predicted confidence. In addition to explainability benefits, we observe modest performance boosts from incorporating model uncertainty.",1
"Most literature in fairness has focused on improving fairness with respect to one single model or one single objective. However, real-world machine learning systems are usually composed of many different components. Unfortunately, recent research has shown that even if each component is ""fair"", the overall system can still be ""unfair"".  In this paper, we focus on how well fairness composes over multiple components in real systems. We consider two recently proposed fairness metrics for rankings: exposure and pairwise ranking accuracy gap. We provide theory that demonstrates a set of conditions under which fairness of individual models does compose. We then present an analytical framework for both understanding whether a system's signals can achieve compositional fairness, and diagnosing which of these signals lowers the overall system's end-to-end fairness the most. Despite previously bleak theoretical results, on multiple data-sets -- including a large-scale real-world recommender system -- we find that the overall system's end-to-end fairness is largely achievable by improving fairness in individual components.",1
"We introduce the concept of expected exposure as the average attention ranked items receive from users over repeated samples of the same query. Furthermore, we advocate for the adoption of the principle of equal expected exposure: given a fixed information need, no item receive more or less expected exposure compared to any other item of the same relevance grade. We argue that this principle is desirable for many retrieval objectives and scenarios, including topical diversity and fair ranking. Leveraging user models from existing retrieval metrics, we propose a general evaluation methodology based on expected exposure and draw connections to related metrics in information retrieval evaluation. Importantly, this methodology relaxes classic information retrieval assumptions, allowing a system, in response to a query, to produce a distribution over rankings instead of a single fixed ranking. We study the behavior of the expected exposure metric and stochastic rankers across a variety of information access conditions, including ad hoc retrieval and recommendation. We believe that measuring and optimizing expected exposure metrics using randomization opens a new area for retrieval algorithm development and progress.",1
"   We address a relatively under-explored aspect of human–computer interaction: people’s abilities to understand the relationship between a machine learning model’s stated performance on held-out data and its expected performance post deployment. We conduct large-scale, randomized human-subject experiments to examine whether laypeople’s trust in a model, measured in terms of both the frequency with which they revise their predictions to match those of the model and their self-reported levels of trust in the model, varies depending on the model’s stated accuracy on held-out data and on its observed accuracy in practice. We find that people’s trust in a model is affected by both its stated accuracy and its observed accuracy, and that the effect of stated accuracy can change depending on the observed accuracy. Our work relates to re- cent research on interpretable machine learning, but moves beyond the typical focus on model internals, exploring a different component of the machine learning pipeline.   ",1
"Classification models are often used to make decisions that affect humans: whether to approve a loan application, extend a job offer, or provide insurance. In such applications, individuals should have the ability to change the decision of the model. When a person is denied a loan by a credit scoring model, for example, they should be able to change the input variables of the model in a way that will guarantee approval. Otherwise, this person will be denied the loan so long as the model is deployed, and -- more importantly --will lack agency over a decision that affects their livelihood. In this paper, we propose to evaluate a linear classification model in terms of recourse, which we define as the ability of a person to change the decision of the model through actionable input variables (e.g., income vs. age or marital status). We present an integer programming toolkit to: (i) measure the feasibility and difficulty of recourse in a target population; and (ii) generate a list of actionable changes for a person to obtain a desired outcome. We discuss how our tools can inform different stakeholders by using them to audit recourse for credit scoring models built with real-world datasets. Our results illustrate how recourse can be significantly affected by common modeling practices, and motivate the need to evaluate recourse in algorithmic decision-making.",0
"Algorithms are now routinely used to make consequential decisions that affect human lives. Examples include college admissions, medical interventions or law enforcement. While algorithms empower us to harness all information hidden in vast amounts of data, they may inadvertently amplify existing biases in the available datasets. This concern has sparked increasing interest in fair machine learning, which aims to quantify and mitigate algorithmic discrimination. Indeed, machine learning models should undergo intensive tests to detect algorithmic biases before being deployed at scale. In this paper, we use ideas from the theory of optimal transport to propose a statistical hypothesis test for detecting unfair classifiers. Leveraging the geometry of the feature space, the test statistic quantifies the distance of the empirical distribution supported on the test samples to the manifold of distributions that render a pre-trained classifier fair. We develop a rigorous hypothesis testing mechanism for assessing the probabilistic fairness of any pre-trained logistic classifier, and we show both theoretically as well as empirically that the proposed test is asymptotically correct. In addition, the proposed framework offers interpretability by identifying the most favorable perturbation of the data so that the given classifier becomes fair.",0
"Knowing when a classifier's prediction can be trusted is useful in many applications and critical for safely using AI. While the bulk of the effort in machine learning research has been towards improving classifier performance, understanding when a classifier's predictions should and should not be trusted has received far less attention. The standard approach is to use the classifier's discriminant or confidence score; however, we show there exists an alternative that is more effective in many situations. We propose a new score, called the &lbrace;\it trust score&rbrace;, which measures the agreement between the classifier and a modified nearest-neighbor classifier on the testing example. We show empirically that high (low) trust scores produce surprisingly high precision at identifying correctly (incorrectly) classified examples, consistently outperforming the classifier's confidence score as well as many other baselines. Further, under some mild distributional assumptions, we show that if the trust score for an example is high (low), the classifier will likely agree (disagree) with the Bayes-optimal classifier. Our guarantees consist of non-asymptotic rates of statistical consistency under various nonparametric settings and build on recent developments in topological data analysis.",1
"NeurIPS 2020 requested that research paper submissions include impact statements on ‘potential nefarious uses and the consequences of failure.’ When researching, designing, and implementing systems, a key challenge to anticipating risks, however, is to overcome what Clarke (1962) called ‘failures of imagination.’ The growing research on bias, fairness, and transparency in computational systems aims to illuminate and mitigate harms, and could thus help inform reflections on possible negative impacts of particular pieces of technical work. The prevalent notion of computational harms — narrowly construed as either allocational or representational harms — does not fully capture the context dependent and unobservable nature of harms across the wide range of AI infused systems. The current literature primarily addresses only a small range of examples of harms to motivate algorithmic fixes, overlooking the wider scope of probable harms and the way these harms may affect different stakeholders. The system affordances and possible usage scenarios may also exacerbate harms in unpredictable ways, as they determine stakeholders’ control (including non-users) over how they interact with a system output. To effectively assist in anticipating and identifying harmful uses, we argue that frameworks of harms must be context-aware and consider a wider range of potential stakeholders, system affordances, uses, and outputs, as well as viable proxies for assessing harms in the widest sense.",1
"We mathematically compare four competing definitions of group-level nondiscrimination: demographic parity, equalized odds, predictive parity, and calibration. Using the theoretical framework of Friedler et al., we study the properties of each definition under various worldviews, which are assumptions about how, if at all, the observed data is biased. We argue that different worldviews call for different definitions of fairness, and we specify the worldviews that, when combined with the desire to avoid a criterion for discrimination that we call disparity amplification, motivate demographic parity and equalized odds. We also argue that predictive parity and calibration are insufficient for avoiding disparity amplification because predictive parity allows an arbitrarily large inter-group disparity and calibration is not robust to post-processing. Finally, we define a worldview that is more realistic than the previously considered ones, and we introduce a new notion of fairness that corresponds to this worldview.",0
"With the public release of embedding models, itâs important to understand the various biases that they contain. Developers who use them should be aware of the biases inherent in the models as well as how biases can manifest in downstream applications that use these models. In this post, we examine a few specific forms of bias and suggest tools for evaluating as well as mitigating bias.",1
"Non-profits, as well as the media, have hypothesized the existence of a radicalization pipeline on YouTube, claiming that users systematically progress towards more extreme content on the platform. Yet, there is to date no substantial quantitative evidence of this alleged pipeline. To close this gap, we conduct a large-scale audit of user radicalization on YouTube. We analyze 330,925 videos posted on 349 channels, which we broadly classified into four types: Media, the Alt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W.), and the Alt-right. According to the aforementioned radicalization hypothesis, channels in the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite serve as gateways to fringe far-right ideology, here represented by Alt-right channels. Processing 72M+ comments, we show that the three channel types indeed increasingly share the same user base; that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content; and that a large percentage of users who consume Alt-right content now consumed Alt-lite and I.D.W. content in the past. We also probe YouTube's recommendation algorithm, looking at more than 2M video and channel recommendations between May/July 2019. We find that Alt-lite content is easily reachable from I.D.W. channels, while Alt-right videos are reachable only through channel recommendations. Overall, we paint a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on YouTube.",0
"This work examines how to train fair classifiers in settings where training labels are corrupted with random noise, and where the error rates of corruption depend both on the label class and on the membership function for a protected subgroup. Heterogeneous label noise models systematic biases towards particular groups when generating annotations. We begin by presenting analytical results which show that naively imposing parity constraints on demographic disparity measures, without accounting for heterogeneous and group-dependent error rates, can decrease both the accuracy and the fairness of the resulting classifier. Our experiments demonstrate these issues arise in practice as well. We address these problems by performing empirical risk minimization with carefully defined surrogate loss functions and surrogate constraints that help avoid the pitfalls introduced by heterogeneous label noise. We provide both theoretical and empirical justifications for the efficacy of our methods. We view our results as an important example of how imposing fairness on biased data sets without proper care can do at least as much harm as it does good.",0
"Powered by machine learning techniques, social media provides an unobtrusive lens into individual behaviors, emotions, and psychological states. Recent research has successfully employed social media data to predict mental health states of individuals, ranging from the presence and severity of mental disorders like depression to the risk of suicide. These algorithmic inferences hold great potential in supporting early detection and treatment of mental disorders and in the design of interventions. At the same time, the outcomes of this research can pose great risks to individuals, such as issues of incorrect, opaque algorithmic predictions, involvement of bad or unaccountable actors, and potential biases from intentional or inadvertent misuse of insights. Amplifying these tensions, there are also divergent and sometimes inconsistent methodological gaps and under-explored ethics and privacy dimensions. This paper presents a taxonomy of these concerns and ethical challenges, drawing from existing literature, and poses questions to be resolved as this research gains traction. We identify three areas of tension: ethics committees and the gap of social media research; questions of validity, data, and machine learning; and implications of this research for key stakeholders. We conclude with calls to action to begin resolving these interdisciplinary dilemmas.",1
"Targeted social policies are the main strategy for poverty alleviation across the developing world. These include targeted cash transfers (CTs), as well as targeted subsidies in health, education, housing, energy, childcare, and others. Due to the scale, diversity, and widespread relevance of targeted social policies like CTs, the algorithmic rules that decide who is eligible to benefit from them---and who is not---are among the most important algorithms operating in the world today. Here we report on a year-long engagement towards improving social targeting systems in a couple of developing countries. We demonstrate that a shift towards the use of AI methods in poverty-based targeting can substantially increase accuracy, extending the coverage of the poor by nearly a million people in two countries, without increasing expenditure. However, we also show that, absent explicit parity constraints, both status quo and AI-based systems induce disparities across population subgroups. Moreover, based on qualitative interviews with local social institutions, we find a lack of consensus on normative standards for prioritization and fairness criteria. Hence, we close by proposing a decision-support platform for distributed governance, which enables a diversity of institutions to customize the use of AI-based insights into their targeting decisions.",0
"Spurious features interfere with the goal of obtaining robust models that perform well across many groups within the population. A natural remedy is to remove such features from the model. However, in this work, we show that removing spurious features can surprisingly decrease accuracy due to the inductive biases of overparameterized models. In noiseless overparameterized linear regression, we completely characterize how the removal of spurious features affects accuracy across different groups (more generally, test distributions). In addition, we show that removal of spurious features can decrease the accuracy even on balanced datasets (where each target co-occurs equally with each spurious feature); and it can inadvertently make the model more susceptible to other spurious features. Finally, we show that robust self-training produces models that no longer depend on spurious features without affecting their overall accuracy. The empirical results on the Toxic-Comment-Detection and CelebA datasets show that our results hold in non-linear models.",0
"Environmental data science is uniquely placed to respond to essentially complex and fantastically worthy challenges related to arresting planetary destruction. Trust is needed for facilitating collaboration between scientists who may share datasets and algorithms, and for crafting appropriate science-based policies. Achieving this trust is particularly challenging because of the numerous complexities, multi-scale variables, interdependencies and multi-level uncertainties inherent in environmental data science. Virtual Labs---easily accessible online environments provisioning access to datasets, analysis and visualisations---are socio-technical systems which, if carefully designed, might address these challenges and promote trust in a variety of ways. In addition to various system properties that can be utilised in support of effective collaboration, certain features which are commonly seen to benefit trust---transparency and provenance in particular---appear applicable to promoting trust in and through Virtual Labs. Attempting to realise these features in their design reveals, however, that their implementation is more nuanced and complex than it would appear. Using the lens of affordances, we argue for the need to carefully articulate these features, with consideration of multiple stakeholder needs on balance, so that these Virtual Labs do in fact promote trust. We argue that these features not be conceived as widgets that can be imported into a given context to promote trust; rather, whether they promote trust is a function of how systematically designers consider various (potentially conflicting) stakeholder trust needs.",0
"The moral authority of ethics codes stems from an assumption that they serve a unified society, yet this ignores the political aspects of any shared resource. The sociologist Howard S. Becker challenged researchers to clarify their power and responsibility in the classic essay: Whose Side Are We On. Building on Becker's hierarchy of credibility, we report on a critical discourse analysis of data ethics codes and emerging conceptualizations of beneficence, or the ""social good"", of data technology. The analysis revealed that ethics codes from corporations and professional associations conflated consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. Interviews with community organizers about social change in the digital era supplement the analysis, surfacing the limits of technical solutions to concerns of marginalized communities. Given evidence that highlights the gulf between the documents and lived experiences, we argue that ethics codes that elevate consumers may simultaneously subordinate the needs of vulnerable populations. Understanding contested digital resources is central to the emerging field of public interest technology. We introduce the concept of digital differential vulnerability to explain disproportionate exposures to harm within data technology and suggest recommendations for future ethics codes..",0
"We propose measurement modeling from the quantitative social sciences as a framework for understanding fairness in computational systems. Computational systems often involve unobservable theoretical constructs, such as socioeconomic status, teacher effectiveness, and risk of recidivism. Such constructs cannot be measured directly and must instead be inferred from measurements of observable properties (and other unobservable theoretical constructs) thought to be related to them---i.e., operationalized via a measurement model. This process, which necessarily involves making assumptions, introduces the potential for mismatches between the theoretical understanding of the construct purported to be measured and its operationalization. We argue that many of the harms discussed in the literature on fairness in computational systems are direct results of such mismatches. We show how some of these harms could have been anticipated and, in some cases, mitigated if viewed through the lens of measurement modeling. To do this, we contribute fairness-oriented conceptualizations of construct reliability and construct validity that unite traditions from political science, education, and psychology and provide a set of tools for making explicit and testing assumptions about constructs and their operationalizations. We then turn to fairness itself, an essentially contested construct that has different theoretical understandings in different contexts. We argue that this contestedness underlies recent debates about fairness definitions: although these debates appear to be about different operationalizations, they are, in fact, debates about different theoretical understandings of fairness. We show how measurement modeling can provide a framework for getting to the core of these debates.",1
"(Bolukbasi et al., 2016) demonstrated that pre-trained  word embeddings  can  inherit  gender bias from the data they were trained on.  We investigate  how  this  bias  affects  downstream classification  tasks,  using  the  case  study  of occupation  classification  (De-Arteaga  et  al.,2019). We show that traditional techniques for debiasing embeddings can actually worsen the bias of the downstream classifier by providing a less noisy  channel  for  communicating  gender information.   With  a  relatively  minor  adjustment, however, we show how these same techniques can be used to simultaneously reduce bias and obtain high classification accuracy.",1
"In domains such as criminal justice, medicine, and social welfare, decision makers increasingly have access to algorithmic Risk Assessment Instruments (RAIs). RAIs estimate the risk of an adverse outcome such as recidivism or child neglect, potentially informing high-stakes decisions such as whether to release a defendant on bail or initiate a child welfare investigation. It is important to ensure that RAIs are fair, so that the benefits and harms of such decisions are equitably distributed. The most widely used algorithmic fairness criteria are formulated with respect to observable outcomes, such as whether a person actually recidivates, but these criteria are misleading when applied to RAIs. Since RAIs are intended to inform interventions that can reduce risk, the prediction itself affects the downstream outcome. Recent work has argued that fairness criteria for RAIs should instead utilize potential outcomes, i.e. the outcomes that would occur in the absence of an appropriate intervention [11]. However, no methods currently exist to satisfy such fairness criteria. In this paper, we target one such criterion, counterfactual equalized odds. We develop a post-processed predictor that is estimated via doubly robust estimators, extending and adapting previous postprocessing approaches [16] to the counterfactual setting. We also provide doubly robust estimators of the risk and fairness properties of arbitrary fixed post-processed predictors. Our predictor converges to an optimal fair predictor at fast rates. We illustrate properties of our method and show that it performs well on both simulated and real data.",0
"Cross-lingual generalization issues for less explored languages have been broadly tackled in recent NLP studies. In this study, we apply the philosophy on the problem of translation gender bias, which necessarily involves multilingualism and socio-cultural diversity. Beyond the conventional evaluation criteria for the social bias, we aim to put together various aspects of linguistic viewpoints into the measuring process, to create a template that makes evaluation less tilted to specific types of language pairs. With a manually constructed set of content words and template, we check both the accuracy of gender inference and the fluency of translation, for German, Korean, Portuguese, and Tagalog. Inference accuracy and disparate impact, namely the biasedness factors associated with each other, show that the failure of bias mitigation threatens the delicacy of translation. Furthermore, our analyses on each system and language indicate that the translation fluency and inference accuracy are not necessarily correlated. The results implicitly suggest that the amount of available language resources that boost up the performance might amplify the bias cross-linguistically.",0
"We demonstrate that it is possible to train large recurrent language models with user-level differential privacy guarantees with only a negligible cost in predictive accuracy. Our work builds on recent advances in the training of deep networks on user-partitioned data and privacy accounting for stochastic gradient descent. In particular, we add user-level privacy protection to the federated averaging algorithm, which makes ""large step"" updates from user-level data. Our work demonstrates that given a dataset with a sufficiently large number of users (a requirement easily met by even small internet-scale datasets), achieving differential privacy comes at the cost of increased computation, rather than in decreased utility as in most prior work. We find that our private LSTM language models are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to un-noised models when trained on a large dataset.",1
"Impact assessments have received particular attention on both sides of the Atlantic as a tool for implementing algorithmic accountability. The aim of this paper is to address how Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) (Art. 35) in the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) link the GDPR's two approaches to algorithmic accountability---individual rights and systemic governance--- and potentially lead to more accountable and explainable algorithms. We argue that algorithmic explanation should not be understood as a static statement, but as a circular and multi-layered transparency process based on several layers (general information about an algorithm, group-based explanations, and legal justification of individual decisions taken). We argue that the impact assessment process plays a crucial role in connecting internal company heuristics and risk mitigation to outward-facing rights, and in forming the substance of several kinds of explanations.",0
"We survey 146 papers analyzing “bias” in NLP systems,  finding that their motivations are often vague, inconsistent, and  lacking in normative reasoning, despite the fact that analyzing “bias”  is an inherently normative process. We further find that these papers’  proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating “bias” are  poorly matched to their motivations and do not engage with the relevant  literature outside of NLP. Based on these findings, we describe the  beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations that  should guide work analyzing “bias” in NLP systems. These recommendations  rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and  social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to  articulate their conceptualizations of “bias”—i.e., what kinds of system  behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the  normative reasoning underlying these statements—and to center work  around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP  systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between  technologists and such communities.",1
"Recommender systems often rely on models which are trained to maximize accuracy in predicting user preferences. When the systems are deployed, these models determine the availability of content and information to different users. The gap between these objectives gives rise to a potential for unintended consequences, contributing to phenomena such as filter bubbles and polarization. In this work, we consider directly the information availability problem through the lens of user recourse. Using ideas of reachability, we propose a computationally efficient audit for top-N linear recommender models. Furthermore, we describe the relationship between model complexity and the effort necessary for users to exert control over their recommendations. We use this insight to provide a novel perspective on the user cold-start problem. Finally, we demonstrate these concepts with an empirical investigation of a state-of-the-art model trained on a widely used movie ratings dataset.",1
"A popular methodology for building binary decision-making classifiers in the presence of imperfect information is to first construct a calibrated non-binary ""scoring"" classifier, and then to post-process this score to obtain a binary decision. We study various fairness (or, error-balance) properties of this methodology, when the non-binary scores are calibrated over all protected groups, and with a variety of post-processing algorithms. Specifically, we show: First, there does not exist a general way to post-process a calibrated classifier to equalize protected groups' positive or negative predictive value (PPV or NPV). For certain ""nice"" calibrated classifiers, either PPV or NPV can be equalized when the post-processor uses different thresholds across protected groups. Still, when the post-processing consists of a single global threshold across all groups, natural fairness properties, such as equalizing PPV in a nontrivial way, do not hold even for ""nice"" classifiers. Second, when the post-processing stage is allowed to defer on some decisions (that is, to avoid making a decision by handing off some examples to a separate process), then for the non-deferred decisions, the resulting classifier can be made to equalize PPV, NPV, false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) across the protected groups. This suggests a way to partially evade the impossibility results of Chouldechova and Kleinberg et al., which preclude equalizing all of these measures simultaneously. We also present different deferring strategies and show how they affect the fairness properties of the overall system. We evaluate our post-processing techniques using the COMPAS data set from 2016.",0
"Can we achieve an adequate level of explanation for complex machine learning models in high-risk AI applications when applying the EU data protection framework? In this article, we address this question, analysing from a multidisciplinary point of view the connection between existing legal requirements for the explainability of AI systems and the current state of the art in the field of explainable AI. We present a case study of a real-life scenario designed to illustrate the application of an AI-based automated decision making process for the medical diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The scenario exemplifies the trend in the usage of increasingly complex machine-learning algorithms with growing dimensionality of data and model parameters. Based on this setting, we analyse the challenges of providing human legible explanations in practice and we discuss their legal implications following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Although it might appear that there is just one single form of explanation in the GDPR, we conclude that the context in which the decision-making system operates requires that several forms of explanation are considered. Thus, we propose to design explanations in multiple forms, depending on: the moment of the disclosure of the explanation (either ex ante or ex post); the audience of the explanation (explanation for an expert or a data controller and explanation for the final data subject); the layer of granularity (such as general, group-based or individual explanations); the level of the risks of the automated decision regarding fundamental rights and freedoms. Consequently, explanations should embrace this multifaceted environment. Furthermore, we highlight how the current inability of complex, deep learning based machine learning models to make clear causal links between input data and final decisions represents a limitation for providing exact, human-legible reasons behind specific decisions. This makes the provision of satisfactorily, fair and transparent explanations a serious challenge. Therefore, there are cases where the quality of possible explanations might not be assessed as an adequate safeguard for automated decision-making processes under Article 22(3) GDPR. Accordingly, we suggest that further research should focus on alternative tools in the GDPR (such as algorithmic impact assessments from Article 35 GDPR or algorithmic lawfulness justifications) that might be considered to complement the explanations of automated decision-making.",0
"Trusted AI literature to date has focused on the trust needs of users who knowingly interact with discrete AIs. Conspicuously absent from the literature is a rigorous treatment of public trust in AI. We argue that public distrust of AI originates from the underdevelopment of a regulatory ecosystem that would guarantee the trustworthiness of the AIs that pervade society. Drawing from structuration theory and literature on institutional trust, we offer a model of public trust in AI that differs starkly from models driving Trusted AI efforts. This model provides a theoretical scaffolding for Trusted AI research which underscores the need to develop nothing less than a comprehensive and visibly functioning regulatory ecosystem. We elaborate the pivotal role of externally auditable AI documentation within this model and the work to be done to ensure it is effective, and outline a number of actions that would promote public trust in AI. We discuss how existing efforts to develop AI documentation within organizations---both to inform potential adopters of AI components and support the deliberations of risk and ethics review boards---is necessary but insufficient assurance of the trustworthiness of AI. We argue that being accountable to the public in ways that earn their trust, through elaborating rules for AI and developing resources for enforcing these rules, is what will ultimately make AI trustworthy enough to be woven into the fabric of our society.",1
"Classifiers can be trained with data-dependent constraints to satisfy fairness goals, reduce churn, achieve a targeted false positive rate, or other policy goals. We study the generalization performance for such constrained optimization problems, in terms of how well the constraints are satisfied at evaluation time, given that they are satisfied at training time. To improve generalization, we frame the problem as a two-player game where one player optimizes the model parameters on a training dataset, and the other player enforces the constraints on an independent validation dataset. We build on recent work in two-player constrained optimization to show that if one uses this two-dataset approach, then constraint generalization can be significantly improved. As we illustrate experimentally, this approach works not only in theory, but also in practice.",1
"Ensuring differential privacy of models learned from sensitive user data is an important goal that has been studied extensively in recent years. It is now known that for some basic learning problems, especially those involving high-dimensional data, producing an accurate private model requires much more data than learning without privacy. At the same time, in many applications it is not necessary to expose the model itself. Instead users may be allowed to query the prediction model on their inputs only through an appropriate interface. Here we formulate the problem of ensuring privacy of individual predictions and investigate the overheads required to achieve it in several standard models of classification and regression.",1
"Recent work on interpretability in machine learning and AI has focused on the building of simplified models that approximate the true criteria used to make decisions. These models are a useful pedagogical device for teaching trained professionals how to predict what decisions will be made by the complex system, and most importantly how the system might break. However, when considering any such model it's important to remember Box's maxim that ""All models are wrong but some are useful."" We focus on the distinction between these models and explanations in philosophy and sociology. These models can be understood as a ""do it yourself kit"" for explanations, allowing a practitioner to directly answer ""what if questions"" or generate contrastive explanations without external assistance. Although a valuable ability, giving these models as explanations appears more difficult than necessary, and other forms of explanation may not have the same trade-offs. We contrast the different schools of thought on what makes an explanation, and suggest that machine learning might benefit from viewing the problem more broadly.",0
"Ethics curricula in computer science departments should include a focus on the political action of students. While 'ethics' holds significant sway over current discourse in computer science, recent work, particularly in data science, has shown that this discourse elides the underlying political nature of the problems that it aims to solve. In order to avoid these pitfalls---such as co-option, whitewashing, and assumed universal values---we should recognize and teach the political nature of computing technologies, largely through science and technology studies. Education is an essential focus not just intrinsically, but also because computing students end up joining the companies which have outsize impacts on our lives. At those companies, students both have a responsibility to society and agency beyond just engineering decisions, albeit not uniformly. I propose that we move away from strict ethics curricula and include examples of and calls for political action of students and future engineers. Through such examples---calls to action, practitioner reflections, legislative engagement, direct action---we might allow engineers to better recognize both their diverse agencies and responsibilities.",0
"NLP models are shown to suffer from robustness issues, for example, a model's prediction can be easily changed under small perturbations to the input. In this work, we aim to present a Controlled Adversarial Text Generation (CAT-Gen) model that, given an input text, it can generate adversarial texts through controllable attributes that are known to be invariant to task labels. For example, for a main task like sentiment classification, an example attribute can be different categories/domains, and a model should have similar performance across them; for a coreference resolution task, a model's performance should not differ across different demographic attributes. Different from many existing adversarial text generation approaches, we show that our model can generate adversarial texts that are more fluent, diverse, and with better task-label invariance guarantees. We aim to use this model to generate counterfactual texts that could better improve robustness in NLP models (e.g., through adversarial training), and we argue that our generation can create more natural attacks.",1
"What does it mean for a clustering to be fair? One popular approach seeks to ensure that each cluster contains groups in (roughly) the same proportion in which they exist in the population. The normative principle at play is balance: any cluster might act as a representative of the data, and thus should reflect its diversity. But clustering also captures a different form of representativeness. A core principle in most clustering problems is that a cluster center should be representative of the cluster it represents, by being ""close"" to the points associated with it. This is so that we can effectively replace the points by their cluster centers without significant loss in fidelity, and indeed is a common ""use case"" for clustering. For such a clustering to be fair, the centers should ""represent"" different groups equally well. We call such a clustering a group-representative clustering. In this paper, we study the structure and computation of group-representative clusterings. We show that this notion naturally parallels the development of fairness notions in classification, with direct analogs of ideas like demographic parity and equal opportunity. We demonstrate how these notions are distinct from and cannot be captured by balance-based notions of fairness. We present approximation algorithms for group representative k-median clustering and couple this with an empirical evaluation on various real-world data sets. We also extend this idea to facility location, motivated by the current problem of assigning polling locations for voting",0
"We show through theory and experiment that gradient-based explanations of a model quickly reveal the model itself. Our results speak to a tension between the desire to keep a proprietary model secret and the ability to offer model explanations. On the theoretical side, we give an algorithm that provably learns a two-layer ReLU network in a setting where the algorithm may query the gradient of the model with respect to chosen inputs. The number of queries is independent of the dimension and nearly optimal in its dependence on the model size. Of interest not only from a learning-theoretic perspective, this result highlights the power of gradients rather than labels as a learning primitive. Complementing our theory, we give effective heuristics for reconstructing models from gradient explanations that are orders of magnitude more query-efficient than reconstruction attacks relying on prediction interfaces.",0
"Machine learning is often viewed as an inherently value-neutral process: statistical tendencies in the training inputs are simply'' used to generalize to new examples. However when models impact social systems such as interactions between humans, these patterns learned by models have normative implications. It is important that we ask not onlywhat patterns exist in the data?'', but also ``how do we want our system  to impact people?'' In particular, because minority and marginalized members of society are often statistically underrepresented in data sets, models may have undesirable disparate impact on such groups. As such, objectives of social equity and distributive justice require that we develop tools for both identifying and interpreting harms introduced by models.",1
"There are many competing definitions of what statistical properties make a machine learning model fair. Unfortunately, research has shown that some key properties are mutually exclusive. Realistic models are thus necessarily imperfect, choosing one side of a trade-off or the other. To gauge perceptions of the fairness of such realistic, imperfect models, we conducted a between-subjects experiment with 502 Mechanical Turk workers. Each participant compared two models for deciding whether to grant bail to criminal defendants. The first model equalized one potentially desirable model property, with the other property varying across racial groups. The second model did the opposite. We tested pairwise trade-offs between the following four properties: accuracy; false positive rate; outcomes; and the consideration of race. We also varied which racial group the model disadvantaged. We observed a preference among participants for equalizing the false positive rate between groups over equalizing accuracy. Nonetheless, no preferences were overwhelming, and both sides of each trade-off we tested were strongly preferred by a non-trivial fraction of participants. We observed nuanced distinctions between participants considering a model ""unbiased"" and considering it ""fair."" Furthermore, even when a model within a trade-off pair was seen as fair and unbiased by a majority of participants, we did not observe consensus that a machine learning model was preferable to a human judge. Our results highlight challenges for building machine learning models that are perceived as fair and broadly acceptable in realistic situations.",0
"The use of cash bail as a mechanism for detaining defendants pretrial is an often-criticized system that many have argued violates the presumption of ""innocent until proven guilty."" Many studies have sought to understand both the long-term effects of cash bail's use and the disparate rate of cash bail assignments along demographic lines (race, gender, etc). However, such work is often susceptible to problems of infra-marginality - that the data we observe can only describe average outcomes, and not the outcomes associated with the marginal decision. In this work, we address this problem by creating a hierarchical Bayesian model of cash bail assignments. Specifically, our approach models cash bail decisions as a probabilistic process whereby judges balance the relative costs of assigning cash bail with the cost of defendants potentially skipping court dates, and where these skip probabilities are estimated based upon features of the individual case. We then use Monte Carlo inference to sample the distribution over these costs for different magistrates and across different races. We fit this model to a data set we have collected of over 50,000 court cases in the Allegheny and Philadelphia counties in Pennsylvania. Our analysis of 50 separate judges shows that they are uniformly more likely to assign cash bail to black defendants than to white defendants, even given identical likelihood of skipping a court appearance. This analysis raises further questions about the equity of the practice of cash bail, irrespective of its underlying legal justification.",0
"There has been recent interest by payers, health care systems, and researchers in the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence models that predict an individual's probability of developing opioid use disorder. The scores generated by these algorithms can be used by physicians to tailor the prescribing of opioids for the treatment of pain, reducing or foregoing prescribing to individuals deemed to be at high risk, or increasing prescribing for patients deemed to be at low risk. This paper constructs a machine learning algorithm to predict opioid use disorder risk using commercially available claims data similar to those utilized in the development of proprietary opioid use disorder prediction algorithms. We study risk scores generated by the machine learning model in a setting with quasi-experimental variation in the likelihood that doctors prescribe opioids, generated by changes in the legal structure for monitoring physician prescribing. We find that machine-predicted risk scores do not appear to correlate at all with the individual-specific heterogeneous treatment effect of receiving opioids. The paper identifies a new source of algorithmic unfairness in machine learning applications for health care and precision medicine, arising from the researcher's choice of objective function. While precision medicine should guide physician treatment decisions based on the heterogeneous causal impact of a course of treatment for an individual, allocating treatments to individuals receiving the most benefit and recommending caution for those most likely to experience harmful side effects, ML models in health care are often trained on proxies like individual baseline risk, and are not necessarily informative in deciding who would most benefit, or be harmed, by a course of treatment.",0
"We present a system to hide a full color image inside another of the same size with minimal quality loss to either image.  Deep neural networks are simultaneously trained to create the hiding and revealing processes and are designed to specifically work as a pair.  The system is trained on images drawn randomly from the ImageNet database, and works well on natural images from a wide variety of sources.  Beyond demonstrating the successful application of deep learning to hiding images, we examine how the result is achieved and apply numerous transformations to analyze if image quality in the host and hidden image can be maintained.  These transformation range from simple image manipulations to sophisticated machine learning-based adversaries. Two extensions to the basic system are presented that mitigate the possibility of discovering the content of the hidden image.  With these extensions, not only can the hidden information be kept secure, but the system can be used to hide even more than a single image. Applications for this technology include image authentication, digital watermarks, finding exact regions of image manipulation, and storing meta-information about image rendering and content.",1
"   The goal of the TREC Fair Ranking track was to develop a benchmark for evaluating retrieval systems in terms of fairness to different content providers in addition to classic notions of relevance. As part of the benchmark, we defined standardized fairness metrics with evaluation protocols and released a dataset for the fair ranking problem. The 2019 task focused on reranking academic paper abstracts given a query. The objective was to fairly represent relevant authors from several groups that were unknown at the system submission time. Thus, the track emphasized the development of systems which have robust performance across a variety of group definitions. Participants were provided with querylog data (queries, documents, and relevance) from Semantic Scholar. This paper presents an overview of the track, including the task definition, descriptions of the data and the annotation process, as well as a comparison of the performance of submitted systems.

"We study the problem of model extraction in natural language processing, where an adversary with query access to a victim model attempts to reconstruct a local copy of the model. We show that when both the adversary and victim model fine-tune existing pretrained models such as BERT, the adversary does not need to have access to any training data to mount the attack. Indeed, we show that randomly sampled sequences of words, which do not satisfy grammar structures, make effective queries to extract textual models. This is true even for complex tasks such as natural language inference or question answering. ",1
"As research on algorithms and their impact proliferates, so do calls for scrutiny/accountability of algorithms. A systematic review of the work that has been done in the field of 'algorithmic accountability' has so far been lacking. This contribution puts forth such a systematic review, following the PRISMA statement. 242 English articles from the period 2008 up to and including 2018 were collected and extracted from Web of Science and SCOPUS, using a recursive query design coupled with computational methods. The 242 articles were prioritized and ordered using affinity mapping, resulting in 93 'core articles' which are presented in this contribution. The recursive search strategy made it possible to look beyond the term 'algorithmic accountability'. That is, the query also included terms closely connected to the theme (e.g. ethics and AI, regulation of algorithms). This approach allows for a perspective not just from critical algorithm studies, but an interdisciplinary overview drawing on material from data studies to law, and from computer science to governance studies. To structure the material, Bovens's widely accepted definition of accountability serves as a focal point. The material is analyzed on the five points Bovens identified as integral to accountability: its arguments on (1) the actor, (2) the forum, (3) the relationship between the two, (3) the content and criteria of the account, and finally (5) the consequences which may result from the account. The review makes three contributions. First, an integration of accountability theory in the algorithmic accountability discussion. Second, a cross-sectoral overview of the that same discussion viewed in light of accountability theory which pays extra attention to accountability risks in algorithmic systems. Lastly, it provides a definition of algorithmic accountability based on accountability theory and algorithmic accountability literature.",0
"Most recommendation engines today are based on predicting user engagement, e.g. predicting whether a user will click on an item or not. However, there is potentially a large gap between engagement signals and a desired notion of value that is worth optimizing for. We use the framework of measurement theory to (a) confront the designer with a normative question about what the designer values, (b) provide a general latent variable model approach that can be used to operationalize the target construct and directly optimize for it, and (c) guide the designer in evaluating and revising their operationalization. We implement our approach on the Twitter platform on millions of users. In line with established approaches to assessing the validity of measurements, we perform a qualitative evaluation of how well our model captures a desired notion of ""value"".",1
"Despite a growing literature on creating interpretable machine learning methods, there have been few experimental studies of their effects on end users. We present a series of large-scale, randomized, pre-registered experiments in which participants were shown functionally identical models that varied only in two factors thought to influence interpretability: the number of input features and the model transparency (clear or black-box). Participants who were shown a clear model with a small number of features were better able to simulate the model’s predictions. However, contrary to what one might expect when manipulating interpretability, we found no significant difference in multiple measures of trust across conditions. Even more surprisingly, increased transparency hampered people’s ability to detect when a model has made a sizeable mistake. These findings emphasize the importance of studying how models are presented to people and empirically verifying that interpretable models achieve their intended effects on end users.",1
"One of the important challenges regarding the development of morally responsible and ethically qualified digital technologies is how to support designers and developers in producing those technologies, especially when conceptualizing their vision of what the technology will be, how it will benefit users, and avoid doing harm. However, traditional software design and development life cycles do not explicitly support the reflection upon either ethical or moral issues. In this paper we look at how a number of ethical issues may be dealt with during digital technology design and development, to prevent damage and improve technological fairness, accountability, and transparency. Starting from mature work on semiotic theory and methods in human-computer interaction, we propose to extend the core artifact used in semiotic engineering of human-centered technology design, so as to directly address moral responsibility and ethical issues. The resulting extension is an epistemic tool, that is, an instrument to create and elaborate on this specific kind of knowledge. The paper describes the tool, illustrates how it is to be used, and discusses its promises and limitations against the background of related work. It also includes proposed empirical studies, accompanied by briefly described methodological challenges and considerations that deserve our attention.",0
"China's Social Credit System (SCS, 社会信用体系 or shehui xinyong tixi) is expected to become the first digitally-implemented nationwide scoring system with the purpose to rate the behavior of citizens, companies, and other entities. Thereby, in the SCS, ""good"" behavior can result in material rewards and reputational gain while ""bad"" behavior can lead to exclusion from material resources and reputational loss. Crucially, for the implementation of the SCS, society must be able to distinguish between behaviors that result in reward and those that lead to sanction. In this paper, we conduct the first transparency analysis of two central administrative information platforms of the SCS to understand how the SCS currently defines ""good"" and ""bad"" behavior. We analyze 194,829 behavioral records and 942 reports on citizens' behaviors published on the official Beijing SCS website and the national SCS platform ""Credit China"", respectively. By applying a mixed-method approach, we demonstrate that there is a considerable asymmetry between information provided by the so-called Redlist (information on ""good"" behavior) and the Blacklist (information on ""bad"" behavior). At the current stage of the SCS implementation, the majority of explanations on blacklisted behaviors includes a detailed description of the causal relation between inadequate behavior and its sanction. On the other hand, explanations on redlisted behavior, which comprise positive norms fostering value internalization and integration, are less transparent. Finally, this first SCS transparency analysis suggests that socio-technical systems applying a scoring mechanism might use different degrees of transparency to achieve particular behavioral engineering goals.",0
"Quantitative definitions of what is unfair and what is fair have been introduced in multiple disciplines for well over 50 years, including in education, hiring, and machine learning. We trace how the notion of fairness has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression). This work points the way towards future research and measurement of (un)fairness that builds from our modern understanding of fairness while incorporating insights from the past.",1
"Those working on policy, digital ethics and governance often refer to issues in 'computer science', that includes, but is not limited to, common subfields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Science (CS) Computer Security (InfoSec), Computer Vision (CV), Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Systems, (IS), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Systems Architecture. Within this framework, this paper is a preliminary exploration of two hypotheses, namely 1) Each community has differing inclusion of minoritised groups (using women as our test case, by identifying female-sounding names); and 2) Even where women exist in a community, they are not published representatively. Using data from 20,000 research records, totalling 503,318 names, preliminary data supported our hypothesis. We argue that ACM has an ethical duty of care to its community to increase these ratios, and to hold individual computing communities to account in order to do so, by providing incentives and a regular reporting system, in order to uphold its own Code.",0
"As machine learning becomes increasingly incorporated within high impact decision ecosystems, there is a growing need to understand the long-term behaviors of deployed ML-based decision systems and their potential consequences. Most approaches to understanding or improving the fairness of these systems have focused on static settings without considering long-term dynamics. This is understandable; long term dynamics are hard to assess, particularly because they do not align with the traditional supervised ML research framework that uses fixed data sets. To address this structural difficulty in the field, we advocate for the use of simulation as a key tool in studying the fairness of algorithms. We explore three toy examples of dynamical systems that have been previously studied in the context of fair decision making for bank loans, college admissions, and allocation of attention. By analyzing how learning agents interact with these systems in simulation, we are able to extend previous work, showing that static or single-step analyses do not give a complete picture of the long-term consequences of an ML-based decision system. We provide an extensible open-source software framework for implementing fairness-focused simulation studies and further reproducible research, available at https://github.com/google/ml-fairness-gym.",1
"The discovery of heavy hitters (most frequent items) in user-generated data streams drives improvements in the app and web ecosystems, but can incur substantial privacy risks if not done with care. To address these risks, we propose a distributed and privacy-preserving algorithm for discovering the heavy hitters in a population of user-generated data streams. We leverage the sampling property of our distributed algorithm to prove that it is inherently differentially private, without requiring additional noise. We also examine the trade-off between privacy and utility, and show that our algorithm provides excellent utility while also achieving strong privacy guarantees. A significant advantage of this approach is that it eliminates the need to centralize raw data while also avoiding the significant loss in utility incurred by local differential privacy. We validate our findings both theoretically, using worst-case analyses, and practically, using a Twitter dataset with 1.6M tweets and over 650k users. Finally, we carefully compare our approach to Apple's local differential privacy method for discovering heavy hitters.",1
"The use of location data has greatly benefited from the availability of location-based services, the popularity of social networks, and the accessibility of public location data sets. However, in addition to providing users with the ability to obtain accurate driving directions or the convenience of geo-tagging friends and pictures, location is also a very sensitive type of data, as attested by more than a decade of research on different aspects of privacy related to location data.",1
"Recently, there have been increasing calls for computer science curricula to complement existing technical training with topics related to Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics (FATE). In this paper, we present Value Cards, an educational toolkit to inform students and practitioners the social impacts of different machine learning models via deliberation. This paper presents an early use of our approach in a college-level computer science course. Through an in-class activity, we report empirical data for the initial effectiveness of our approach. Our results suggest that the use of the Value Cards toolkit can improve students' understanding of both the technical definitions and trade-offs of performance metrics and apply them in real-world contexts, help them recognize the significance of considering diverse social values in the development and deployment of algorithmic systems, and enable them to communicate, negotiate and synthesize the perspectives of diverse stakeholders. Our study also demonstrates a number of caveats we need to consider when using the different variants of the Value Cards toolkit. Finally, we discuss the challenges as well as future applications of our approach.",0
"Despite vigorous debates about the technical characteristics of risk assessments being deployed in the U.S. criminal justice system, remarkably little research has studied how these tools affect actual decision-making processes. After all, risk assessments do not make definitive decisions---they inform judges, who are the final arbiters. It is therefore essential that considerations of risk assessments be informed by rigorous studies of how judges actually interpret and use them. This paper takes a first step toward such research on human interactions with risk assessments through a controlled experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We found several behaviors that call into question the supposed efficacy and fairness of risk assessments: our study participants 1) underperformed the risk assessment even when presented with its predictions, 2) could not effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, and 3) exhibited behaviors fraught with ""disparate interactions,"" whereby the use of risk assessments led to higher risk predictions about black defendants and lower risk predictions about white defendants. These results suggest the need for a new ""algorithm-in-the-loop"" framework that places machine learning decision-making aids into the sociotechnical context of improving human decisions rather than the technical context of generating the best prediction in the abstract. If risk assessments are to be used at all, they must be grounded in rigorous evaluations of their real-world impacts instead of in their theoretical potential.",0
"In this work, we study notions of fairness in decision-making systems when individuals have diverse preferences over the possible outcomes of the decisions. Our starting point is the seminal work of Dwork et al. [ITCS 2012] which introduced a notion of individual fairness (IF): given a task-specific similarity metric, every pair of individuals who are similarly qualified according to the metric should receive similar outcomes. We show that when individuals have diverse preferences over outcomes, requiring IF may unintentionally lead to less-preferred outcomes for the very individuals that IF aims to protect (e.g. a protected minority group). A natural alternative to IF is the classic notion of fair division, envy-freeness (EF): no individual should prefer another individual's outcome over their own. Although EF allows for solutions where all individuals receive a highly-preferred outcome, EF may also be overly-restrictive for the decision-maker. For instance, if many individuals agree on the best outcome, then if any individual receives this outcome, they all must receive it, regardless of each individual's underlying qualifications for the outcome. We introduce and study a new notion of preference-informed individual fairness (PIIF) that is a relaxation of both individual fairness and envy-freeness. At a high-level, PIIF requires that outcomes satisfy IF-style constraints, but allows for deviations provided they are in line with individuals' preferences. We show that PIIF can permit outcomes that are more favorable to individuals than any IF solution, while providing considerably more flexibility to the decision-maker than EF. In addition, we show how to efficiently optimize any convex objective over the outcomes subject to PIIF for a rich class of individual preferences. Finally, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the PIIF framework by extending our definitions and algorithms to the multiple-task targeted advertising setting introduced by Dwork and Ilvento [ITCS 2019].",0
"We present the Language Interpretability Tool (LIT), an open-source platform for visualization and understanding of NLP models. We focus on core questions about model behavior: Why did my model make this prediction? When does it perform poorly? What happens under a controlled change in the input? LIT integrates local explanations, aggregate analysis, and counterfactual generation into a streamlined, browser-based interface to enable rapid exploration and error analysis. We include case studies for a diverse set of workflows, including exploring counterfactuals for sentiment analysis, measuring gender bias in coreference systems, and exploring local behavior in text generation. LIT supports a wide range of models--including classification, seq2seq, and structured prediction--and is highly extensible through a declarative, framework-agnostic API. LIT is under active development, with code and full documentation available at https://github.com/pair-code/lit.",1
"Computer vision and other biometrics data science applications have commenced a new project of profiling people. Rather than using 'transaction generated information', these systems measure the 'real world' and produce an assessment of the 'world state' - in this case an assessment of some individual trait. Instead of using proxies or scores to evaluate people, they increasingly deploy a logic of revealing the truth about reality and the people within it. While these profiling knowledge claims are sometimes tentative, they increasingly suggest that only through computation can these excesses of reality be captured and understood. This article explores the bases of those claims in the systems of measurement, representation, and classification deployed in computer vision. It asks if there is something new in this type of knowledge claim, sketches an account of a new form of computational empiricism being operationalised, and questions what kind of human subject is being constructed by these technological systems and practices. Finally, the article explores legal mechanisms for contesting the emergence of computational empiricism as the dominant knowledge platform for understanding the world and the people within it.",0
